<h2>Who?</h2>
<p class="large">
  My name is Ryan Bigg. I am someone who teaches other people how to program. I do this through my mentoring and my book writing.
</p>

<p class="large">
  When I am not mentoring or writing books, I'm working full-time at <a href='http://cultureamp.com'>Culture Amp</a>, where I use <a href='https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/'>Ruby</a> and <a href='http://elixir-lang.org'>Elixir</a> daily.
</p>

<p class="large">
  I'm best known for my work on the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org'>Rails Guides</a>, <a href='http://manning.com/bigg2'>Rails 4 in Action</a>, <a href='https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails-2'>Multitenancy with Rails</a> and <a href='https://leanpub.com/toyrobot'>my walkthrough of the Toy Robot exercise</a>. I'm currently writing a new book called <a href='https://leanpub.com/ddr'>Deep Dive Rails</a>.
</p>

<p class="large">
  You might know me from <a href='/books'>the books I've written</a>, <a href='/opensource'>any of the open source work I've done</a>, <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/users/15245/ryan-bigg'>my addiction to Stack Overflow</a> or <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org'>The Rails Guides</a> that I helped write.

</p>

<p>
  I won a <a href='http://rubyheroes.com'>Ruby Hero</a> award in 2011 for my work on the Rails guides. As part of this work, I worked on the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html'>Getting Started with Rails</a>, <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html'>Active Record Query Interface</a> <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html'>Asset Pipeline</a> , <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html'>Configuring Rails Applications</a> and the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html'>Getting Started with Engines</a>. I also wrote a <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2014/10/ubuntu-ruby-ruby-install-chruby-and-you/'>Ruby setup guide for Ubuntu</a> and <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2015/06/mac-os-x-ruby-ruby-install-chruby-and-you/'>one for Mac OS X</a>.

<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>
  Over my development life I've worked with many, many teams developing Elixir, Phoenix, Ruby, Rails, Go and React applications. (Thankfully, not all of those languages/frameworks at the same time.)
</p>

<p>
  I've contributed extensively to open source and I'm most well-known in this regard for having maintained <a href='https://github.com/spree/spree'>Spree</a> for two and a half years. You can see <a href='https://github.com/radar'>more examples of my work on GitHub</a>.
