<h3>Career</h3>

<p>
  Over my career I've worked with many, many teams developing Elixir, Phoenix, Ruby, Rails, Go and React applications. (Thankfully, not all of those languages/frameworks at the same time.)
</p>

<p>
  The proudest accomplishments of my coding career have been:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href='https://cultureamp.com'>Culture Amp</a> &mdash; Junior Engineering Program Lead - mentoring junior engineers to become confident and capable engineers in a 6-month program. Prior to that: Built microservices in Elixir which talked to Elastic Search instances. Integrated the results from these services into our monolithic Rails application, which uses React/Redux.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href='https://github.com/spree/spree'>Spree</a> &mdash; I was the Community Manager for Spree for two and a half years. During this work, I grew the community substantially while managing the open source projects. Got paid to travel the world and promote Spree.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href='https://lifx.co'>LIFX</a> &mdash; Worked on a small team of developers to build LIFX's cloud API, using a mixture of Ruby and Go. Built a small Go project to simulate 100,000 concurrent connections to our message broker to load test it.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href='https://getup.org.au'>GetUp</a> &mdash; Worked with a small team of PHP developers and taught them Ruby and Rails while rebuilding the GetUp site from scratch.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Open Source</h3>

<p>
  I've contributed extensively to open source and I'm most well-known in this regard for having maintained <a href='https://github.com/spree/spree'>Spree</a>. Other open source projects that I am proud of include:

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href='https://github.com/radar/twist'>Twist</a> &mdash; A book review tool that allows readers to leave review notes / errata on the book as they read it. Almost every book I have written has been reviewed through Twist.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href='https://github.com/radar/by_star'>ByStar</a> &mdash; An extension to Active Record that lets you find records within a time range by providing methods like <code>by_month</code> and <code>by_year</code>. Works on Active Record and Mongoid.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href='https://github.com/radar/elastic'>Elastic</a> &mdash; A small Elixir package that I built to talk to Elastic Search.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href='https://github.com/radar/summer'>Summer</a> &mdash; A tiny IRC bot framework which drives the #rubyonrails channel bot, <a href='https://github.com/radar/railsbot'>helpa</a>. There's also a companion Phoenix app which presents the channel logs, called <a href='https://github.com/radar/logs.ex'>logs.ex</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
