<p class="large">
  I'm a husband and new dad, to a daughter (Ella) born in September 2016. Being a dad is very awesome. Seeing a little human grow is the most amazing thing. Ella is now walking by herself, and is getting very good at communicating what she wants. She's taken an interest in the piano.
</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>
  When I'm not husband-ing or dad-ing I'm working full-time at <a href='http://cultureamp.com'>Culture Amp</a>. I'm the Junior Engineering Program Lead there, mentoring 10 junior developers in how we do software development at Culture Amp, with a focus on Ruby and JavaScript. I'm currently in-between cohorts at the moment, but will likely be hiring more soon.
</p>

<p>
  My talk <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD6dci9rLXM'>about Hiring Juniors from RubyConf AU in March</a>has just been published. You can <a href='https://www.ryanbigg.com/2018/03/hiring-juniors'>read the transcript here</a>. I've just given a shorter version of this talk at <a href='https://www.webdirections.org/leaders/'>Web Directions Code Leaders</a> and the video for that will be published soon-ish.
</p>

<p>
  In my spare time, I'm continuing to write <a href='https://joyofelixir.com'>Joy of Elixir</a>. This book is a gentle introduction to programming for first-timers, teaching them the ways of Elixir. Why I'm writing it is best explained by it <a href='https://joyofelixir.com/about.html'>about page</a>. I'm hoping to have it complete by the end of 2018. I'm about three or four chapters away from that. Now that the conference talks are out of the way, I can focus more time on this.
</p>

<p>
  I'm the current Treasurer of <a href='https://ruby.org.au'>Ruby Australia</a>. This mostly involves paying bills, and making sure others have paid their bills on time.
</p>

<p>
  I've <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2015/11/open-source-work'>quit maintaining my open source projects</a>, but you might see me <a href='https://github.com/radar'>dabble around here and there</a>. A lot of my dabbling recently has been on the <a href='https://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n'>i18n</a> gem, which comes packaged with every single Rails application. My task with the i18n gem is to review PRs and to do new releases as neccessary. It's fairly light (but important) work, so I'm fine with doing it.

<h3>Reading</h3>

<p>
  I'm a super-keen reader of (mainly) fantasy and sci-fi and here's the last 5 books that I've read:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Persepolis-Rising-Expanse-James-Corey/dp/0316332836'>Persopolis Rising</a> - currently reading - Book 7 of the Expanse Series. Set in the not-to-distant future where humans have semi-mastered space travel. Lots of science based in reality. Also: the way that they hint at aliens without there actually being aliens makes for very, very interesting reading.</li>
  <li><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34002132-oathbringer'>Oathbringer - Book 3 of the Stormlight Archive</a> - I have a "thing" for any fantasy written by  Brandon Sanderson. Oathbringer is great and builds further on the epic world from the first 2 books.</li>
  <li><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68427.Elantris'>Elantris</a> - Sanderson's first big book, but I've only just read it now. As per usual, a great world built by Sanderson with an even more amazing magic system and characters.</li>
  <li><a href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IK1J9TO/'>The Queen of the Tearling</a> - I raced through all three books in this trilogy in about two weeks.</li>
  <li><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31817749-the-stone-sky'>The Stone Sky</a> - Book 3 of the Broken Earth Trilogy. My favourite recent sci-fi / fantasy read in a loooong time. Yes, even better than Sanderson.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Of course, like pretty much <em>everyone else on the planet</em>, I'm waiting for <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21032488-doors-of-stone'>The Doors of Stone by Patrick Rothfuss</a>, the 3rd book of the Kingkiller Chronicle, a book far-too-many-years in the making. C'mon man, just ship it!
</p>

<p>
  And speaking of books that have taken too long to publish: I'm also waiting on <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8074907-the-thorn-of-emberlain'>The Thorn of Emberlain</a> - book 4 in the Gentleman Bastards series. For this series: think Oceans 11 with a shitload more swearing (and inventive insults) set in medieval times. Oh, and there's magic. Sort of.
