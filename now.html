<p class="large">
  I'm a husband and new dad, to a daughter born in September 2016. Being a dad is very awesome. Seeing a little human grow is the most amazing thing.
</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>
  When I'm not husband-ing or dad-ing I'm working full-time at <a href='http://cultureamp.com'>Culture Amp</a>. I am about to start a Junior Engineering Program there, mentoring 8 junior developers in how we do software development at Culture Amp, with a focus on Ruby and Elixir. I'm currently building curriculum for this program.
</p>

<p>
  I'm mentoring / advising some juniors outside of work at the moment and <a href='/juniors.html'>share my answers to their questions</a> so that other juniors can read them (and it saves me time having to write them all out again!). I also do some mentoring on Thursday nights one-on-one with a junior. I'm going to stop doing this in 2018 as my wife is taking on a full-time job.
</p>

<p>
  I am writing <a href='https://joyofelixir.com'>Joy of Elixir</a> in my free time (read: during my commute). This book is a gentle introduction to programming for first-timers, teaching them the ways of Elixir. Why I'm writing it is best explained by it <a href='https://joyofelixir.com/about.html'>about page</a>. I'm hoping to have it complete by the end of 2017.
</p>

<p>
  I'm the current Secretary of <a href='https://ruby.org.au'>Ruby Australia</a>. This mostly involves keeping minutes for the association's committee meetings, but also involves some light paperwork and other duties.
</p>

<p>
  I've <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2015/11/open-source-work'>quit maintaining my open source projects</a>, but you might see me <a href='https://github.com/radar'>dabble around here and there</a>. A lot of my dabbling recently has been on the <a href='https://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n'>i18n</a> gem, which comes packaged with every single Rails application. My task with the i18n gem is to review PRs and to do new releases as neccessary. It's fairly light (but important) work, so I'm fine with doing it.

<h3>Reading</h3>

<p>
  I'm a super-keen reader of (mainly) fantasy and sci-fi and here's what I've been reading recently.
</p>

<p>
  I've just finished reading The Tearling Trilogy, read all three books in about two weeks. Here's a link to the first book: <a href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IK1J9TO/'>The Queen of the Tearling</a>. Kelsea is a fearsome character.
</p>

<p>
  Just before that I finished reading <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31817749-the-stone-sky'>the third book of The Broken Earth Trilogy by N.K. Jemisin</a>. Absolutely fantastic world-building, writing, characters, and so on. Frankly one of my favourite all-time reads.
</p>

<p>
  I'm <em>eagerly</em> awaiting <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Oathbringer-Book-Three-Stormlight-Archive/dp/076532637X'>Oathbringer</a>, the third book of the Stormlight Archive series. The first book took a little while for me to warm up to but once it got going it was <em>fantastic</em>. I consumed the second book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Words-Radiance-Stormlight-Archive-Book/dp/0765326361'>(Words of Radiance)</a> in under a week, despite its tome-li-ness.
</p>

<p>
  I'm also waiting for <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Persepolis-Rising-Expanse-James-Corey/dp/0316332836'>Persepolis Rising</a>, the 7th book in The Expanse series. Brilliant sci-fi with a massive human focus, full of adventure and action. Love it.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, like pretty much <em>everyone else on the planet</em>, I'm waiting for <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21032488-doors-of-stone'>The Doors of Stone by Patrick Rothfuss</a>, the 3rd book of the Kingkiller Chronicle, a book far-too-many-years in the making. C'mon man, just ship it!
