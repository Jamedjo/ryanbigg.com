  I'm a husband and new dad, to a daughter (Ella) born in September 2016. Being a dad is very awesome. Seeing a little human grow is the most amazing thing. Ella is very good at communicating and running now! She's just learned that she can raise her eyebrows, which is hilarious.

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>
  When I'm not husband-ing or dad-ing I'm working full-time at <a href='http://cultureamp.com'>Culture Amp</a>. I'm the Junior Engineering Program Lead there. We've just finished a round of hiring, and the next cohort (JEP #2) starts in January. In the meantime, I'm planning out the first 6 weeks of curriculum, focussing on browser tech (HTML, CSS & JS) first, then moving from there to Ruby, databases, and Rails.

  You can read my <a href='/2018/08/junior-engineering-program-resources'>notes on the first JEP program here</a>.

<p>
  In my spare time, I'm continuing to write <a href='https://joyofelixir.com'>Joy of Elixir</a>. This book is a gentle introduction to programming for first-timers, teaching them the ways of Elixir. Why I'm writing it is best explained by it <a href='https://joyofelixir.com/about.html'>about page</a>. Last now update I said I would have this finished by the end of 2018. It's mostly there. Maybe it might get done by then. But also, maybe not.

<h3>Life</h3>

<p>
  As we get toward the end of the year, I'm looking forward to taking some time off over Christmas and spending that time with my extended family.
