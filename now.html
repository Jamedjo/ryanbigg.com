  I'm a husband and new dad, to a daughter born in September 2016. Being a dad is very awesome.
</p>

<p>
  I'm working full-time at <a href='http://cultureamp.com'>Culture Amp</a>. I am doing a lot of Elixir work, with touches of Ruby. I am trying to push for <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2016/04/hiring-juniors'>more juniors to be hired.</a> Mainly so I can mentor them, since that's what I enjoy doing most.
</p>

<p>
  I am writing <a href='https://leanpub.com/ddr'>Deep Dive Rails</a>. This book demystifies the Rails initialization process, and also how Rails handles requests.
</p>

<p>
  I'm the current Secretary of <a href='https://ruby.org.au'>Ruby Australia</a>. This mostly involves keeping minutes for the association's committee meetings, but also involves some light paperwork and other duties.
</p>

<p>
  I've <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2015/11/open-source-work'>quit maintaining my open source projects</a>, but you might see me dabble around here and there.
