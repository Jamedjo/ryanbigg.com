  First and foremost: I'm a husband to Sharon and a dad to Ella. Being
  a dad is very awesome. Seeing a little human grow is the most amazing thing. Ella is now making friends through
  daycare and she's sharing her energetic personality with people other than her close family.

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>
  Culture Amp's Junior Engineering Program <a href='/2019/07/culture-amp-junior-engineering-program-discontinued'>has
    been discontinued</a> in November. This means that my role as JEP Lead has been made redundant at Culture Amp and I
  have now left the company.
</p>

<p>
  In December, I joined Coder Academy as a lead educator and spent four months there mentoring junior-junior developers
  and writing curriculum. Then in April I was stood down due to COVID-19 affecting the business.
</p>

<p>
  So I am now currently out there looking for work!

<h3>Writing</h3>

<p>
  In my spare time, I'm continuing to write
  <a href="https://joyofelixir.com">Joy of Elixir</a>. This book is a gentle
  introduction to programming for first-timers, teaching them the ways of
  Elixir. Why I'm writing it is best explained by it
  <a href="https://joyofelixir.com/about.html">about page</a>. Now that I'm out of a full-time job, I have plenty of
  time to finish writing this book. Allegedly.
</p>

<p>
  I've also recently got the rights to the <a href='https://manning.com/bigg2'>Rails 4 in Action</a> book series from
  Manning (only after an eight-year battle) -- and I'm <em>contemplating</em> how I would go about updating this book
  for Rails 6. It'd be a massive undertaking (several months, at least!), and I'm hoping to get other co-authors on
  board to help with it.
