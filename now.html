  I'm a husband and new dad, to a daughter born in September 2016. Being a dad is very awesome. Seeing a little human grow is the most amazing thing.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not husband-ing or dad-ing, I'm working full-time at <a href='http://cultureamp.com'>Culture Amp</a>. I am doing a lot of Elixir work, with touches of Ruby. I am going to be starting a new role there soon as the Junior Devleoper Program Lead, teaching Ruby (and maybe Elixir!). More news on that front soon.

</p>

<p>
  I'm mentoring / advising some juniors at the moment and <a href='/juniors.html'>share my answers to their questions</a> so that other juniors can read them (and it saves me time having to write them all out again!)
</p>

<p>
  I am writing <a href='https://joyofelixir.com'>Joy of Elixir</a> in my free time. This book is a gentle introduction to programming for first-timers, teaching them the ways of Elixir. Why I'm writing it is best explained by it <a href='https://joyofelixir.com/about.html'>about page</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I'm the current Secretary of <a href='https://ruby.org.au'>Ruby Australia</a>. This mostly involves keeping minutes for the association's committee meetings, but also involves some light paperwork and other duties.
</p>

<p>
  I've <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2015/11/open-source-work'>quit maintaining my open source projects</a>, but you might see me dabble around here and there.
