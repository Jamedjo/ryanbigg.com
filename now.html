  First and foremost: I'm a husband to Sharon and a dad to Ella. Being
  a dad is very awesome. Seeing a little human grow is the most amazing thing. Ella is now making friends through
  daycare and she's sharing her energetic personality with people other than her close family.

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>
  I've just started working at <a href='https://covidence.org'>Covidence</a> as a senior developer.

<h3>Writing</h3>

<p>
  In my spare time, I'm continuing to write
  <a href="https://joyofelixir.com">Joy of Elixir</a>. This book is a gentle
  introduction to programming for first-timers, teaching them the ways of
  Elixir. Why I'm writing it is best explained by it
  <a href="https://joyofelixir.com/about.html">about page</a>.

  I've also recently got the rights to the <a href='https://manning.com/bigg2'>Rails 4 in Action</a> book series from
  Manning (only after an eight-year battle) -- and with a few other co-authors I've updated it for Rails 6. It's now called <a href='https://activerailsbook.com'>Active Rails</a>.
