I was joking on Eyerc yesterday that we haven't yet had a power outage, and at dad's house last night just after he finished cooking dinner, the power went out. gg etsa.

I went over Dad's for dinner last night and he was telling me he was sick of getting calls from telemarketers. We joked about what we should do when these idiots call up.  I bragged about never receiving a single call from a telemarketer since I moved into mum's house.

That changed this morning.

Apparently I'd won a free trip to Florida! So I pressed "9" for more information and waited. This is the worst part, where they call you and then put you on hold. It's a pathetic tactic. I waited some more, and eventually some guy with either a very good or a very bad (depending which way you look at it) american accent came on the line. He greeted me, and I greeted him back with the line: "Never call this number again. Take it off your list. Call it again and I will hunt you down." I don't exactly view these people as human, so I hung up.

So what's your stories for telemarketers? I want comments!
