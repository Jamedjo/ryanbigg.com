I went to the Reloaded festival over the weekend just gone, it was awesome save for the lack of toilets (2 between 400 != good) and complete lack of decently quiet, not bright, comfortable sleeping area and the idiot who made the police come in. A bit tough on the mind, as I was still a tad zombified yesterday, but now I'm back up to normal. Wookie did a wonderful job with the event even though people will always find something to complain about (and did). The main complaint was that the competitions were not ran on time, or ran way overtime (i.e. the CS:S grand final ending hours after the event was supposed to finish)

<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/sets/72157603816659975/"> I didn't take as many photos as last time,</a> mostly because I found other things to do, such as walking around and telling people to shut down their DC++ and FTP servers as they were lagging the network.

There was some Team Fortress 2 playing as well, which is now my favourite game (having racked up ~24 hours on it, I might also be addicted) which was fun listening to people shouting out as well as sending back a few insults of my own.

It was incredibly fun and I won't blog about it too much here because there's too much to blog about. If you want to know what other people thought there is <a href="http://valhalla.net.au/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=11218&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a">a thread on the valhalla forums</a> and <a href="http://www.reloadedlan.com/r3/index.php?topic=717.0">one on the reloaded forums</a>.

In other news, I'm holding another RadarLAN at my dad's house this coming Friday. As far as I know these are the people who are coming:

1. Me
2. Tom
3. Devastator
4. Freddy
5. minus_infinite
6. ax
9. Thommo
10. Paul
11. Michael
12. Michael's Friend
13. James
14. Terra
15. Joe
16. Nathan
So if people drop out we should still have enough for a decent one.
