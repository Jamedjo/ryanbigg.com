The Australian Government <a href='http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/technology/blogs/the-geek/internet-freedom-in-2010-looks-like-1984/20100618-ykr9.html?rand=1276822049429'>has put forward a scheme which they wish to log the activity of every user of the internet</a>. What. The. Fuck?

Must the government fear its citizens so much that it has to monitor their every movement? Lucky we have a lot of spare land to put the datacenters where to keep this new data they'll be storing. This means data such as sixteen-year-old girls "liking" a picture on Facebook and writing comments like "omg hayley wat r u doing dere?". Seriously, Australia? Fuck.

Again, it's also a load of bullshit. Like the internet filter. People who want to keep their communications secret (VPN / SSL anyone?), will do it. The government *must* find an alternative solution that doesn't involve tracking miniscule internet movements of the majority to capture such an infinitesimally small minority. One person's a terrorist and suddenly we're all suspected of it until proven innocent.

This is not the "democracy" I've grown up knowing. It's, in the words of Muse, "demonocracy". 

It makes me sad that we have a bunch of old fogeys in their ivory towers scheming against the majority without asking it for their opinion. I thought that's what democracy was about. I wish they'd climb to the highest level of their tower and defenestrate their pathetic ideas, followed shortly by theirselves.

You cannot protect everyone from everything all the time. Stop trying.
