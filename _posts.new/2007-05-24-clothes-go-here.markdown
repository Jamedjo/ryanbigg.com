My brother seems to not know where they go, so I made that little sign so that he knows.

In other news, tomorrow is my last day at [s]Hell[/s] Coles, and it's casual day! I hope everything goes smoothly and I'll see you on the other side.

Oh, and about Monday Night, it starts at 6:30, at my house. If you don't know where that is you know how to contact me. Bring $5 for pizza.
