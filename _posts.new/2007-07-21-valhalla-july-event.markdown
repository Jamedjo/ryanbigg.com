Was a very awesome night, and even though Paul, Thommo, Rick and Tom didn't go, I sat with Devastator and had a good time.

I won the competition for Quake 3 Corkscrew and received the gift basket which contained:

2 cans of Fanta
3 cans of Coke
1 block of Kit-Kat Chocolate Overload Chocolate
1 230g packet of Smiths Thinly Cut Original Chips
1 Box of Arnott's Savoury Shapes
1 Packet of Smarties
1 Block of Peppermint Aero
1 Bar of Chocolate Aero
1 Crunchie
1 Cherry Ripe
1 225g packet of Allens Frogs Alive (Red Frogs)
1 225g packet of Allens Party Mix

I've been going to Valhalla for two years and I finally remember to bring my mousepad and win a competition. Coincidence? Probably.

Goodbye another weekend.
