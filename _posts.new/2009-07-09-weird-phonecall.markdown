Got a call from a blocked number today:

Me: "Hello"
Them: "Is this Ian Thorpe?"
Me: "Who?"
Them: "Ian Thorpe."
Me: "Ian Thorpe? As in the swimmer?"
Them: "Yup"
Me: "I think you've got the wrong number, this is Ryan."
Them: "Oh, do you do computer repairs?"
Me: "I can, yes"
Them: "I got your number from Fiona in Secret Harbour"
Me: "What state?" (because I moved in Jan and news travels slowly in the real world)
Them: "WA"
Me: "No sorry, I think you've got the wrong person!" 

I've only ever lived in SA and Queensland.
