So I posted earlier that I'm writing a book on Rails 3 and I asked for suggestions. Thank you greatly to those who sent them in. Now I'm looking to put the final touches on the book and because I was slightly inebriated when I got home I decided to record something in Photo Booth rather than writing it down.

<a href='http://vimeo.com/11354142'>So here it is</a>. If you've ever wanted to stare lovingly into my eyes and hear my soothing voice, here's your chance.

Hopefully with your feedback by the end of next week I should have a good enough table of contents to start writing this epic.

Thanks for being with me so far!
