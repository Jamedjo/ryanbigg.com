When I was attending TAFE me and my friends used to play cards. I haven't played cards in ages, and I'm kind of missing that fact.

So I thought I would host a Poker night for the 27th October.
Open invitation.
It will no longer be held at my Dad's house. It will be held at a friend's house who has kindly volunteered his shed for it.
You know how to contact me.

EDIT:
Yes I did have the third of November listed here as the date, but I had told people that it would be "not this saturday but the one after", so just to make it clear it's the 27th of October.
