I've waited two weeks for my motherboard and RAM to turn up from Just Computing. The first week of waiting was due to them not ordering it, and this week has been due to the supplier making Just Computing jump through all kinds of hoops to let them order stock from them (no wonder why there were reluctant). Apparently my parts are somewhere in Adelaide. If anyone sees an Abit FI-90HD Motherboard coupled with 2x1GB Corsair 667 RAM, please notify me and I'll come around and pick them up.

I ordered a laptop two days ago through my dad. It turned up today. The only problem thus far is that it automatically installs Vista as soon as you turn it on. Vista, for those of you who have been living under a rock, in a coma or under an enormous effect from some psychotropic drug, SUCKS. I need not detail the why, as you may just type "Vista" into Google and get results like this: [url=http://apcmag.com/5049/10_reasons_not_to_get_vista]10 Reasons Not to Get Vista[/url]

In hindsight I should've ordered a laptop with no OS installed, and if that was not possible then I would ask for XP to be installed. On Dad's request, I have run the Recovery Disk Creator using Vista, and after that's done I'm going to stick in a freshly baked Ubuntu CD and exorcise Vista off the hard drive and put Ubuntu in it's place.

In other news, the guys at TravelLink Technology (including me) have decided to stop shaving until the development of the project ends.  We're going to be taking a picture every day throughout the project's development of our faces and also the relationships between the tables. The legacy system's relationship diagram stretches over an A3 page and the font is about size 8, so that'll give you some idea of how many tables there are. I'm going to grab the pictures and put them up on the site as I go along, but I'll make that page another day when I don't have Vista to exorcise.

Wish me luck, see you on the other side.
