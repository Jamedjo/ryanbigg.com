Sometime in the midst of January I'll be moving up to Queensland to go work at <a href='http://mocra.com'>Mocra</a> with <a href='http://bjeanes.net'>Bo Jeanes</a>, <a href='http://github.com/chendo'>Jack "Chendo" Chen</a>, <a href='http://drnicwilliams.com'>Dr Nic Williams</a> and Claire Chapman.

This past week I had a work trial with them and really enjoyed my time up there; the people and code are just so fantastic. Friday was great fun with go-karting, the driving range and laser skirmish.

I'm looking forward to the fun of working there again in January and I do plan on having a going away party for my SA comrades sometime in January.
