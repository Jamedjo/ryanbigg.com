title: "Railscamp #5 Writeup Delay"

I have every intention of eventually doing a writeup on how my Railscamp #5 was but unfortunately I've come down with a flu. It is unknown to me at the present moment if it is the standard flu or swine-flu. I don't care either way. I'm on meds and I'm taking a day, perhaps two, off work in order to recover. I'm also on ease-a-cold meds which aren't helping at all. I cannot focus, and so I think that I'm not in the right state of mind to do a writeup on Railscamp #5. Sorry.

In other completely unrelated news, to the person(s) who had the flu at Railscamp: I will find you. It is only a matter of time.
