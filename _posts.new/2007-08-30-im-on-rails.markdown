Thanks to AgentGreasy's "uber-leet mad skillz" this blog is now running on Rails. I decided to use Rails for my blog because it doesn't show me as a hypocrite for using something else and shows that Rails can be as good as any other programming language out there.

Yes the Upcoming Events box is ugly and yes I will fix it.

I can now use Chronic which lets me say stuff like "two days from next tuesday 2pm" and it gives back [chronic]two days from next tuesday 2pm[/chronic]. Cool, huh?

Also this blog lets me define code blocks:

[code="app/non-existant.rb"]
if i.rule
puts "Rails isn't broken!"
else
puts "Rails is broken!"
end
[/code]

and some cool little span thingies that I can put methods in like [term]reject![/term] and my custom destroy method, [term]obliterate![/term]

And now a fictional story, based on true events and events that I would like to see happen.

I was catching the train into town enjoying tapping away on my laptop and listening to my iPod when this obnoxious Italian kid gets on bored with his mate with no tickets. They start talking loudly, as Italians do, and I quickly get annoyed. So I turn up my iPod a little louder and keep tapping away resisting the urge to throw them both out the train whilst it's still going. I'm about to snap and one of them approaches the door. I think he's about to get off. He opens the door whilst the train's still moving. He invites TWO MORE of his friends into the train and all four of them are now talking obnoxiously loud, as Italians do. I resist the urge to throw one of them under the train until we get to Adelaide.

The next day felt like deja vu. Same guys, same obnoxious talking ("Yous gotta learns to fight doods!") and same temptation to throw them out the train. I hatch a plan and smile slightly to myself knowing the following days are going to be better. That night I phone up AdelaideMetro and tell them some regular commuters are boarding without tickets.

The following day a short woman with grey hair and a huge guy board the train wearing orange AdelaideMetro vests.
"Tickets please" she says as she walks down the aisle towards the obnoxious Italians, checking all the commuter's tickets.
The Italians start to panic. With no money they try to go to the next carriage and find the door's locked.
"Going somewhere?" the huge guy says, coming from nowhere.
"Yeah man, our friends are in the front carriage but the door is jammed.", the 'leader' nervously says to the guard.
"The door's locked, you're going nowhere. Names and addresses please, gentlemen."
"I lost my ticket" one lies to the guard. Now the guard's pissed.
"Bullshit. Names and addresses or I'll throw you out now." The guard replies, cornering them with his sheer size. He notes their information down in a notepad and makes them stand by the door.

They are escorted off at the next station.

At the next station his two friends board and are asked for their tickets. The guard escorts them off at the station after that.

Ahh, sweet justice.
