<a href='http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/23/rubyonrailsorg-domain-derailed-by-hacker/'>TechFail stoops to new lows.</a>. I honestly though the local "news" (here's looking at you news.com.au) reporting was bad. My *god*. <strong>Do your damn research</strong>. You quoted SoftMind. I am using short sentences. This is how I indicate I am in disbelief. It stuns me. Incredibly so. Let me just reiterate that:

<font style='font-size:72pt'>YOU QUOTED SOFTMIND</font>
<font style='font-size:36pt'> QUITE POSSIBLY THE GREATEST (AND BY THAT I MEAN WORST) NOOB THAT EVER LIVED</font>

Ok. I'll calm down now. Honestly guys, SoftMind even <a href="http://twitter.com/WebReservoir/status/1563836044">talks to himself using an alternative twitter account</a> and prattles on about the most mundane shit ever. He surely cannot be your only source of news. He should never be anyone's source of anything. Just ignore him and we can all pray together that he goes away (read: gets hit by a rapidly moving vehicle). 

Please tell me you got the work experience kid to do this and he meant it as a joke, but you guys took it seriously.

Wow. Stunned.
