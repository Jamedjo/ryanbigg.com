Tom is known to be not the smartest person in the world, and I thought, well maybe it's just Tom. Today I was proven that it actually runs in his family. His Aunty Mary stayed over for a week at his house, and left a few things behind including a small keyring with a light on it, a mouse, a keyboard, and a laptop. Yes, a laptop.

Tom's mum came home and later on phoned up Aunty Mary and the conversation went a bit like this:

<strong>Tom's Mum: </strong>Hi, have you left anything behind?
<strong>Mary: </strong>Not that I can think of.
<strong>Tom's Mum:</strong> What about a keyring, with a light on it?
<strong>Mary: </strong>Oh yeah that's Daniel's...
<strong>Tom's Mum: </strong>Anything else?
<strong>Mary: </strong>Noooooo....
<strong>Tom's Mum: </strong>What about a laptop?
<strong>Mary: </strong>Oh! Right...
