Sometime in the past week we reached 10,000 users with [url=http://pulse.offbeat-zero.net]WhatPulse Signature Images[/url].

I kind of made a "promise" that I'd have a LAN party when this would happen and coincidentally there's one this weekend called "Valhalla" which you may have heard of (I think I mentioned it once or twice). Free drinks on me.

P.S. [url=http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/]HAML rocks your world.[/url] Anyone who says otherwise is a liar and deserves to be exported to the Sun.
