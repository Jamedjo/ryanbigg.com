We interrupt the slew of technical bloggings to bring you this announcement:

For the Radar fans out there living in Adelaide you'll be glad to know that I'm coming back down (up?) <strong>there on Wednesday! </strong>That's right, for a <strong>limited time only </strong>I shall return and hang out with as <strong>many of you as humanly possible</strong>. Just because I love you all.

On Wednesday I'll be waking up at some ungodly hour, phoning a cab and then packing my crap. Then I'll take the cab (and my crap) to the airport and I will then catch a flight out to Adelaide and arrive there at around 8:50am. From there on it's fun &amp; festivities with family and friends! Cannot wait to see you all again! Be there!
