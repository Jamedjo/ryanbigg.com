I promised you guys a summary of Railscamp. Unfortunately I managed to lock myself out of sudo on my laptop AND hastily reinstall ubuntu. I could've sworn I had a backup on here somewhere.

Fortunately I'm supposed to be doing a very short presentation about what went on at Railscamp so I should have at least SOMETHING by next weekend!

Been very busy as of late. The blog went down and I've been playing around with WordPress as a replacement instead of re-inventing the wheel yet again. I simply do not have the time or energy to do something that massive again. WordPress does everything I want it to.

On last weekend's Saturday I shaved off the beard and it was itchy. I don't recommend it for anybody to grow a beard for 6 months and shave it all off in one go. It's like that feeling when you get your hair cut and it goes down the back of your shirt. Now imagine that on your face 10 fold.

Also on the Tuesday  (the 4th) just gone, I turned 20. Went out for dinner the Sunday before with my dad, Monday night had dinner at Mum's, Tuesday night was poker, Wednesday night was Cafe Primo, Thursday night was play-around-with-blog night and tonight was get-everything-imported-into-wordpress night.

Tomorrow night I'm off to InLAN with Narthollis, Devastator and Freddy. This InLAN is free and doesn't have prizes, but we'll still own all the noobs.
