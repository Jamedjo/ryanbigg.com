Hilary Clinton.

The only <a href="http://www.news.com.au/common/imagedata/0,,5806861,00.jpg">woman</a> candidate in the 2008 United States "Let's-See-How-Long-We-Can-Drag-This-Out-For" Presidential campaign.

<a href="http://www.duncans.tv/images/sam-kekovich-2007.jpg">Sam Kekovich</a> once stated that "<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/reslib/200706/r151735_541371.jpg">Helen</a> <a href="http://shots.snap.com/preview/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwmmbb.files.wordpress.com%2F2007%2F03%2Fclarke-and-bush.jpg&key=e5a3c1e6dff5de35b1c6e7c470411886&src=pub-2311827-www.wordpress.com&cp=&sb=1&v=3.28.0.3&size=large&lang=en-us&search_type=spasense&origin=shots_bubble&act=only_link&po=0&rp=null&tok=0003482455352a437ac5d648ca9328ef01a4cad315&has_img=1&ol=0&ex=0&ad=unknown&ip=219.90.230.230&ua=Mozilla%2F5.0+(X11%3B+U%3B+Linux+i686%3B+en-US%3B+rv%3A1.9b5)+Gecko%2F2008041514+Firefox%2F3.0b5&vid=b59d3801ad8f1b4514cb1a9b6a437baf&nl=0&referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwmmbb.wordpress.com%2F2007%2F03%2F23%2F1406%2F&svc=&view_id=b59d3801ad8f1b4514cb1a9b6a437baf&goto=Go%20to%20%25URL&direct=1&sc=2&rss=1"> Clark</a> does a passable impersonation of a man", and obviously Hilary Clinton wasn't on his mind at the time. I just hope Hilary doesn't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewinsky_scandal">do what Bill did</a> especially with another woman; more shocking it would be if it was with <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/images/248162/0_61_lewinsky_monica.jpg">the same woman</a>.

It surely is skillful to <a href="http://www.danzfamily.com/archives/blogphotos/07/hillary-clinton-faces-vertical.jpg">have as many facial expression as Ms. Clinton</a>, but how is that going to help the American economy? We all know how bad women are with spending. Would you give one woman the control over an entire country's wallet? I wouldn't.

Let's just hope if she's elected she won't decompose into <a href="http://www.news.com.au/common/imagedata/0,,5806861,00.jpg">Yet Another Old Person</a> unlike a certain <a href="http://www.registers1.com/mccain/images/mccain.jpg">other candidate</a>.
