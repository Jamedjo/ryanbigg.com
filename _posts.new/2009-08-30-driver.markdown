Over the past 24 hours I've worked (not constantly, in bursts) on a little Sinatra app called <a href='http://github.com/radar/driver'>Driver</a>. My inspiration for this was that Passenger Preference Pane was hanging in Mac OS X. Driver acts as an alternative to Passenger Preference Pane and it was a fun little project I did to see if it was possible, and it is. Now your challenge is to get it to work with Linux. Go for it!
