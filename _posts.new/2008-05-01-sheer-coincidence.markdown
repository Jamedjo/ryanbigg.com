Today I was going to put on my music, but I've listened to all the good stuff in there over and over again. I was thinking of putting on Finger Eleven's Paralyzer as it's a catchy song, so I started humming the chorus as I turned to my radio to turn it on.

Not only was it that song on Nova, but it was around a second past where I was just humming it. Freaky.

Also a few years ago, at a family gathering and after Grandad had passed away, the conversation changed topic to his girlfiend, Shirley. No one had heard from her for at least a year, and a few people said they'd seen her in the shops. During this conversation, Aunty Eileen gets a call on her mobile and we joke "Oh that'll be Shirley". Surely enough, Aunty Eileen goes "Oh, hi Shirley", loud enough for the room to hear over the conversation.

Anyone else had something like this?
