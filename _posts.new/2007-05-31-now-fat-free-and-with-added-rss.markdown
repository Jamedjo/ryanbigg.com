Today, on the suggestion of [url=http://www.intrevio.com]Seth Lopez[/url], I implemented RSS into this site. 

If you're using Firefox you should see a little orange feed symbol in your address bar which looks like:
[img]img/other/rss/url.jpg[/img]

When you click it it takes you to another page which will allow you to subscribe to my site's feed.

Further yet, if you want to get updates through Thunderbird that's also possible.

1. Open Thunderbird.
2. Go to Tools -> Account Settings.
3. Click Add Account.
4. Click the "RSS News & Blogs" radio button, then click Next.
5. Type whatever name you want for your feeds. Click next and then finish.
6. Now in the left window of the "Account Settings" screen you will see an option with the name you specified in #5. Click that.
7. Click the "Manage Subscriptions..." button on the right side of that window.
8. A new window should pop-up. Click the Add button.
9. Type in "http://www.frozenplague.net/rss" into the Feed URL box.
10. You should now see a folder icon with the title "The Life of a Radar". Opening up this folder presents you with a satellite dish with the title "The Life of a Radar" again. Close that window.
11. Above your regular email you should now see your RSS News & Blogs account, with the name you wrote in #5.
12. In that folder will be "The Life of a Radar", in bold and with a number in brackets.
13. Clicking it will bring up a list, similar looking to the email list you're familiar with, of blog posts on this site.
14. Clicking a blog post will bring it up.

Welcome to RSS.

P.S. My cold has ran away, if you find it, please DO NOT RETURN IT TO ME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. Keep it as a reward.
