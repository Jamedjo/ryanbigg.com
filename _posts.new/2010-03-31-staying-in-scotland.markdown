This past week I <strong>a</strong>ttended the Scottish Ruby Conference and for the week <strong>pri</strong>or I was experiencing the joy that is Scot<strong>l</strong>and. I have made a decision to stay on a couple o<strong>f</strong> weeks and I ap<strong>o</strong>l<strong>o</strong>gise for those who I haven't yet discussed this with. 

Since the conference, I have been discussions with one of the local companies who wish to hire me to teach Ruby after my contract with GetUp has expired. I'm going to their offices in Edinburgh today for a meeting to discuss this. I think they're fantastic people and it would be almost as much joy to work with them as it has been to work with GetUp and I would name them if it wasn't for a damn NDA. GetUp's going to be exceptionally hard to beat.

I may return to Australia to collect some things and put my affairs in order eventually, but Scotland just feels like the right place to be at the moment. It's much closer to a larger number of countries than Australia with greater opportunities in the Ruby & Rails sectors and I love everything here.

Later on today I will contact GetUp and let them know that I'm still willing to do work for them, albeit remotely, and I hope they will understand.

More on this <strong>l</strong>ater. <strong>S</strong>ee you then!
