title: "Giving Away: One (1) Uncle"

Here's the deal. I have a 50-year old uncle who:
1. Eats my food.
2. Drinks my drink.
3. Cooks only for himself when needed.
4. Lays on the couch watching TV all the time.
5. Works very casually.
6. Pays not a cent towards bills, food or anything.
7. Smokes outside my window.

He also plays the guitar.

I need to find him a new home. I will pay for all transport costs associated worldwide. Think I'm kidding? Try me. I just want him out of this house.

His name is Kym and he originally moved in here for "two days". It's been nearly three months. If you have a spare room and are willing to support him, then contact me at radar@frozenplague.net and I will arrange transport to your location for this leech.
