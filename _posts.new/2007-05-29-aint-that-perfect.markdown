The Friday just gone (well, 4 days ago), was my last day working at Coles. A customer with her kid came through my register, and the kid was coughing up BOTH lungs and sounding not all that good about it.

I joked about it, "Wouldn't it be funny if I got sick on my last day?"

It happened. I now have a cold which I think I'm smack-bang in the middle of. It's wrapped itself around my vocal chords and my voice cracks whenever I try to speak, even saying something simple like "Bye" comes out all distorted.

I hope that this thing goes away before Monday. Wouldn't that be horrible? Turning up to a new job and being sick on the first day.

My energy's completely shot by about 6'oclock every night and I haven't been able to have a good sleep-in because my throat's been feeling like crap.

If anyone wants my cold, they may take it, $4.95 + Postage & Handling.
