title: Faking It

Today I was doing the one thing I truly, truly love doing and that's complaining about writing RSpec tests. I came across a doozy of a problem involving RSpec testing and faking subdomains. Here's a stripped down version of what I did:

<pre lang='rails'>
def login_as(user)
  session["user"] = users(user).id
  request.host = User.find(session["user"]).company.domain + ".example.com"
end
</pre>

Just pop that into your <em>spec/spec_helper.rb</em> and then you can use <span class='term'>login_as(:user)</span> which will find the fixture with the name of "user" and then go from there to setting your faked host as being from, for example, blah.example.com.

Pretty simple, shame Google didn't turn up any relevant results without me having to dig deeper than usual.
