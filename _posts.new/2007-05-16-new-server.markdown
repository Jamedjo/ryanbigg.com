Sometimes I don't know why I do it. I turn on my computer before going off to do other things. Then when I inevitably return, there's a few messages of people screaming bloody murder because my site has an error, or they want to look at a piece of code. The last thing I want to do when I get home is to "help" people. That's what I do all day at work. Give me time to sit down, eat dinner, get out of my work clothes, read a comic or three and then I'll jump straight back into working on fixing whatever bugs you may find. I'll even be nice.

You may realise by now that there isn't a blog post before this one. This is because some idiot (me) forgot to backup his MySQL database, I had everything else backed up except that. It only had one blog post in it anyway, and I wish to re-write it. The blog post was titled "Goodbye, Good Luck and Get Out of my Store" and here's how I want to write it today:

Dear Customers,
I have been working at Coles for 2 years, 2 months and 6 days now. It's time for me to leave, I have found another job somewhere else, that pays more and has better working conditions (including chairs). You may know me as the "spiky-haired guy" or the "one-with-the-grumpy-face", but that's only some of the time. I can be nice, but sometimes it takes a little incentive. That's just how I am. I would like to address you in groups.

I don't know how you do it, but every day you manage to bring in those green bags of yours. Equally repetitive is your famous catch-cry of "Hold on, Dear! I have green bags." as I start scanning them items you put up before your green bags. 

Yes, you can be slow, and lets face it, I'm an impatient bastard, but you do eventually give me a friendly smile and say goodbye. This makes you unique, in a special way. You can give me the correct change most of the time also, which is sometimes a good thing.

[b]The Asians[/b]
If it wasn't for your consistent buying of discounted items our bins would be over-flowing with out of date stock. You are reliable, efficient and smart. You stare at the monitor looking for mistakes, and if there's one you kindly remind me. Sometimes I'll miss one, but you can just go up to the Service Desk and get your 18c refund.

[b]The People Who Talk On Mobile Phones Whilst Being Served[/b]
I find you funny, most of the time. Other times you're tolerable, but I would prefer it if you put your mother on hold for the < 2 minutes it takes me to serve you. You don't need to shout "HELLO?!" down the phone. We don't get signal in the building. Don't ignore me when I tell you that we don't, believe me, I've tried.

In short: Hang up, at least say "hello" to me, get served, get out, and then call them back when you're not inside.

[b]The Parents With Screaming Kids[/b]
This is Coles. Last I know, Coles is not a kindergarten, crechÃ©, or any other child-care facility. I respect the fact that you don't want to leave your kids home alone, or in the car, but please, keep them under control when you're in the store. Occasionally I'm tempted to call security because your children are being absolute ferals. Control your kids.

Aside: Apparently I used to be one of those kids too. Thankfully, they grow up.

[b]FlyBuys users[/b]
Lets point out a few points that you should know during the transactional process:
1. Before handing me the cash, it is wise to hand me the flybuys card. You may also do this during the process, but not after. I have very quick fingers that like to hit the Cash -> Enter button. My job is to scan your items and get you out of the store.
2. You can not use your FlyBuys on the $1.00 bread you bought. It only works for amounts of $5 and over.
3. You get 2 points / $5. Get a life, seriously.
4. If I "forget" to ask you, it's not my fault. Would you be sick of asking for FlyBuys for every customer?

For this point let's elaborate some. Say, on average, it takes me 1 minute to serve customers (on express). Over a 9 hour day I take 1 1/2 hours for lunch & tea breaks. So that's 7.5 hours, or 450 minutes. So that's 450 times I have to ask for FlyBuys. Not going to happen.

That is, unless someone can provide me with a YakBak. Those things were cool back in the day.
