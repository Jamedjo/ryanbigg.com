title: Q & A - Juniors
---

_These questions came out of a Culture Amp JEP Breakfast event that CA hosted on the 2nd October, 2018. These were questions written down by juniors on some index cards. I've split them into three parts: Before the Program, During the Program and After the Program. The answers (written during the following week) for these questions might be helpful to the juniors now and into the future, so I'm posting them here for posterity. These answers might age / change over time. YMMV._

<a name='before' href='#before'><h2>Before the Program</h2></a>

<a name='applicants' href='#applicants'><h3>How many people have applied? What are the chances of getting in the JEP? / How many people are you taking?</h3></a>

For our first program, we received 130 applicants and were aiming to take on 3 people, but ended up taking on 5.

For our 2nd program, we received 108 applicants and are aiming to hire 6 people, as that's what we have space for in our organisation at this point in time. That's the bad news, because it's a very competitive process and this job is in pretty high demand.

The good news is that if we reject you at an step of our interview process we will give you personalised feedback on what you could've done better so that when you apply next time you'll have a better chance of meeting our expectations then. Culture Amp does this because we're a feedback-oriented company, and we strongly believe a flat "no thanks" from us is not great feedback for anyone, juniors included.

  <h3>What are the main 2-3 qualities you are looking for in the JEP (apart from technical)?</h3>
</a>

We're looking for socially outgoing, technically minded people who care about improving company culture all over the world. This is a pretty tricky question to answer without using any buzzwords. It's really one of those "we know it when we see it" things.

The people who did really well during the first JEP rpcoess were all of the above, demonstrating some really good social skills / abilities, and that typically came from them having worked in other industries before applying for the JEP. All of our first-round JEP people were career-changers. So maybe there's something in that to consider.

<a name='ruby-skill' href='#ruby-skill'><h3>How good at Ruby do you actually need to be to move to the tech interview after the coding test? / I don't know a lot of Ruby. Is that going to be a problem?</h3></a>

Let's start with _why_ the coding test is even in Ruby to begin with.

For JEP #1, the idea was for it to be pretty backend focussed as I wanted to teach what I knew best, and at the time that was pretty Ruby weighted. That meant that the first JEP coding test was Ruby too. The 2nd one is also a Ruby-only coding test because I wanted to try it again to see how much I could "improve" the coding test and really test the Ruby abilities of candidates.

Now that I've ran at least one JEP, I realise that there are lots of people coming from mainly two coding backgrounds: lots of backend focus or lots of frontend focus. So it would make more sense perhaps for JEP #3 to have not one Ruby-only coding test, but perhaps a JavaScript test as well, testing on as much of the same things as possible. This could be possible because the two languages share a lot of similarities. It's something I'm mulling over.

Okay, so that's the _why_ out of the way. Now to actually answer the question: for the JEP we're expecting a "baseline" level of Ruby. Things like:

* You know what the different data types are (arrays, hashes, integers, floats, strings, etc.)
* You know how to structure code (methods, classes, modules)
* You know that the Ruby programming language provides a few helper methods in its standard library

These are things that you would probably find out within the first 8-10 chapters of any good Ruby book.

I cover this one in pretty good detail over [on this other page called "Expectations"](https://ryanbigg.com/juniors/expectations.html). I think I wrote it best over there. You should go and read that page!
