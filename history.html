<h2>History</h2>

<h3>August '16 &rarr; Current &mdash; <a href='http://cultureamp.com'>Culture Amp</a></h3>

<p class='large'>
  <a href='http://cultureamp.com'>Culture Amp</a> aims to improve the culture of companies around the world.
</p>

<p class='large'>
  As of August 2017, I am the Junior Engineering Program Lead at Culture Amp. This job involves recruiting and mentoring junior engineers in Ruby and JavaScript (and lots more!) with the goal of training them up to be the next great engineers at Culture Amp and in the wider developer community.
</p>

<p class='large'>
  My work at Culture Amp prior to being the JEP lead, involved me working as a Senior Developer with a small team of developers to maintain our large Rails monolith and to write microservices in Elixir, along with frontends in React, and associated tech.
</p>

<p>
  I love working at Culture Amp because I get to do what I love: mentor and grow junior developers. I also get lots of opportunities to help out other developers by working with them on difficult issues.

<h3>December '08 &rarr; Current &mdash; Programming Author</h3>

<p class='large'>
  I have contributed extensively to documentation for Ruby and Rails. I started writing documentation for Rails in December 2008. The two guides I am best known for are the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html'>Getting Started guide</a> and <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html'>Active Record Querying guide</a>. I also wrote the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html'>Engines guide</a> and the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html'>Asset Pipeline guide</a>.
</p>

<p class='large'>
  During 2010, I was contacted by <a href='https://manning.com'>Manning</a> to write a book for them called <a href='manning.com/books/rails-3-in-action'>Rails 3 in Action</a>. This subsequently went on to produce a second edition, called <a href='https://manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action'>Rails 4 in Action</a>.

<p class='large'>
  After the success of <a href='http://manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action'>Rails 3 and Rails 4 in Action</a> I decided to strike out on my own and become a self-published author. I do this through <a href='https://leanpub.com'>Leanpub</a> and have published two books (<a href='https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails-2'>Multitenancy with Rails</a> and <a href='https://leanpub.com/toyrobot'>Toy Robot</a>) and I'm currently writing a third (<a href='https://leanpub.com/joyofelixir'>Joy of Elixir</a>).
</p>

<p>
  You can read more about these books over on <a href='/books'>my books page</a>.
</p>

<p>
  As a part of this writing process, I developed <a href='https://github.com/radar/twist-v2'>a review tool called "Twist"</a> which allows reviewers to leave notes on my books as they read them. It has been extremely useful.

<h3>January '15 &rarr; August '16 &mdash; <a href='http://marketplacer.com'>Marketplacer</a></h3>

<p class='large'>
  I worked at <a href='http://marketplacer.com'>Marketplacer</a> as a Senior Developer. Marketplacer is an application which powers sites such as <a href='https://www.bikeexchange.com.au'>BikeExchange</a> (also in the <a href='https://www.bikeexchange.com.au'>US</a> and a few countries in Europe), <a href='https://www.tinitrader.com.au'>TiniTrader</a> and <a href='https://www.bikeexchange.com'>BikeExchange</a>. The overall goal of the application is to make it easier for stores and private sellers to sell their goods online.
</p>

<p>
  My day-to-day work involved working on new features for the Marketplacer application, and leading the Core development team. It was here that I was first introduced to Angular and React and where I learned I had a strong preference for React over Angular.

<h3>July '14 &rarr; Jan '15 &mdash; <a href='http://lifx.co'>LIFX</a></h3>

<p class='large'>
  At LIFX I worked on a small team of 3 developers building their Cloud architecture using a mixture of Ruby and Go.
</p>

<p>
  This architecture allows users of LIFX lights to control their lights wherever they are in the world; and also provides integration with Nest. For example, if there's smoke detected in the house by a Nest smoke dectector, the LIFX lights will flash red.

<h3>November '11 &rarr; July '14 &mdash; <a href='http://spreecommerce.com'>Spree Commerce</a></h3>

<p class='large'>
  I was hired as the Community Manager for Spree after showing a very keen interest in the framework. I posted a lot to the user group and then one day Sean Schofield (the CEO of Spree) asked if I wanted a job which was essentially being paid to maintain open source. I said yes.
</p>

<p>
  At Spree I was _the_ Community Manager. This is a fancy title which means my primary responsibility was keeping the community happy. I did this by leading the development of the <a href='https://github.com/spree/spree'>Spree ecommerce framework,</a> answering posts on our user group, writing documentation and giving talks all over the world about Spree. In one instance, I was flown to London to consult with a large surf clothing distributor.

<h3>2005 &rarr; 2011 &mdash; Various</h3>

<p class='large'>
  My formative years. Spent this time working for various companies and freelancing, doing whatever PHP or Ruby on Rails work came my way.
