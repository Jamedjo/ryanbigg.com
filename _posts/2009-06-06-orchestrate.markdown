When I first begun working at Mocra, I worked on a project called <a href='http://orchestrateapp.com'>Orchestrate</a> with some awesome people like Jon Hicks, Jon Leighton and the Mocra crew. We launched Orchestrate to much fanfare in April. Orchestrate is a powerful project and task manager that's perfect for service and maintenance professionals.

Now Orchestrate has a <a href='http://orchestrateapp.com/tour.html'>new tour</a> video done by Ian at <a href='http://procasts.co.uk/'>ProCasts</a> so <a href='http://orchestrateapp.com/tour.html'>go over there now</a> and check it out and spread the word!
