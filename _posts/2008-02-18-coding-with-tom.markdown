Tom asked me Sunday night if I wanted to go over to his house and code with him for the day and I said yes. I joked about being there at 7 in the morning and he said that would be fine.

I woke up at 10:30 and went on IRC and ping'd him only to get no reply, he was watching Burn Notice. Eventually he did reply, and re-scheduled it for 12pm, so I played TF2 for 2 hours.

I went to his house and immediately he wanted to get lunch, so we got lunch. Then whilst we're eating lunch he said he just wanted to finish watching Burn Notice before beginning to code. He did that, he finished watching his show whilst we worked out how to get the local SVN repo going, which is much faster than the Google code repo.

I fixed up all the bugs (stuff not making the code work on 2.0, mainly) whilst he talked on IRC. He thinks he wasn't able to fix up the bugs, but I'm sure if he just focussed and googled the error messages that came up, he would have the necessary mental capabilities to fix them himself.

I've completely moved the admin stuff over to a namespace, changed all the .rhtml files to .html.erb files, made a completely new styles controller (the other one just disappeared) and fixed a few display nuances and as far as I know he has only *begun* to work on his events thing. I think he's written a migration and worked on the form.

At the moment, he has his laptop's back facing me, and he's talking on IRC about becoming an oper on wombat.eyerc.net with Xaphan and also talking with his girlfriend. It makes me wonder why I even came over in the first place.

Back to work, I suppose.
