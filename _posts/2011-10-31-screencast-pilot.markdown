Today I went out and got myself a microphone so I could begin to do some screencasting. I did some back in February for EngineYard and
really enjoyed it and have been wanting to get back into it for a while, but I have been busy writing.

This evening, I <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/screencasts/000-game-of-life.mov'>recorded a 48 minute screencast</a> and how to begin to code a program to do it in Ruby, explaining things as I go along.

You can see the end result on my <a
href='https://github.com/radar/screencasts/tree/master/000-game-of-life'>screencasts repository on GitHub</a>.

Please let me know of any feedback you have on this screencast (i.e. was the keyboard too noisy or did I speak too fast?) or any ideas for future ones you'd be interested in listening to. Ideally, I'd like to do one every week.
