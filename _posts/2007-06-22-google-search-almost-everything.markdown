Today I was looking for the correct syntax of "<=>", I wasn't sure if it was <=> or <==>, so I typed both of them into Google and got back a blank result, not even a "Your search - <=> - did not match any documents." message. I felt unloved!

So my question to Google is: "Why aren't you returning results for this string?"

If anyone is knowledgeable in this subject, please fill me in. I had the idea that I could enter anything into Google and get back unimpeded results, but this does not appear to be the case.
