title: Joy of Elixir

I've been using Elixir at work professionally for the past year and more recently I've been starting to do some mentoring around Elixir. I've noticed that while there are some very solid intermediate books/resources like <a href='https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html'>Getting Started guide on elixir-lang.org</a> the <a href='https://pragprog.com/book/elixir13/programming-elixir-1-3'>Programming Elixir</a> book and even <a href='https://elixirschool.com/'>Elixir School</a>, there doesn't seem to be anything at all book-wise directed at newbies.

**So I decided to write a little book called <a href='https://joyofelixir.com'><em>Joy of Elixir</em></a>.**

<p>
  <strong>Joy of Elixir avoids assuming knowledge of <em>anything</em> about programming while teaching people about their first programming language: Elixir.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  It seemed like there is a vast, empty, <em>cavernous void</em> where there should be something like the excellent <a href='https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/'>Learn to Program book by Chris Pine</a>. That book is for <a href='https://www.ruby-lang.org'>Ruby</a>; but there feels like there should be an equivalent to that for Elixir. I'm hoping <em>Joy of Elixir</em> can be that equivalent.
</p>

<p>
We have people completely new to programming <em>wanting</em> to learn Elixir -- because people who have learned Elixir already told them about it and how cool it is! -- but the support is not-quite-there yet. So this is an attempt to fill that void. Essentially a response to: <em>"Why won't <u>somebody</u> think of the newbies?"</em>. Well, someone <em>is</em> thinking of the newbies.
</p>

<p>
  I want Joy of Elixir to be the go-to-resource for teaching people programming <em>for the very first time</em> using Elixir. I want them to experience the <em>joy</em> that Elixir (and programming in general) can bring to people. I want people to feel like them have power over the machine because of the knowledge contained within this book.
</p>

I want to have a book that I can confidently recommend to newbies when they ask about how they can learn Elixir. If you have a newbie in your life that wants to learn Elixir, point them at this book and let them read it. I'm very keen to get some feedback from newbies (and everyone else) on how the content could be improved.

This book is available <a href='https://joyofelixir.com'>for free online</a> (under <a href='https://github.com/radar/joyofelixir/blob/master/license.txt'>the CC-BY-SA 4.0</a> license, its <a href='https://github.com/radar/joyofelixir'>source is on GitHub</a> and you can <a href='https://leanpub.com/joyofelixir'>buy a PDF version</a> from Leanpub.
