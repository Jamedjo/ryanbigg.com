I received my new laptop last night and after exorcising Vista successfully I am now happily running Ubuntu with a few minor issues. When I right click on the time and click the Adjust button, it presents me with the password dialog box for "time-admin", I enter my password and nothing happens. Obviously this program is not installed, and I have tried apt-get install time-admin and it's not in there, but apart from that everything's smooth.

I received my new motherboard today, an Abit F-I90HD, minus the RAM that needs to go in it to get working. So now I have a motherboard inside my shuttle case with an awesome CPU (E6600) and graphics card (8800GTS), but no RAM. Tomorrow's a RAM shopping day. 

I also have a motherboard not in any case, with CPU, RAM, on-board graphics , a spare IDE cable and a case to put it in, so tomorrow I'm going to put the components in a spare case.

As for my old computer (which really isn't that old), I'm selling the parts. There's a motherboard (Gigabite GA-K8NS-Pro) with an AMD Sempron 3100+, one DDR2 333 stick of 512mb RAM, one DD2 400 stick of 512mb RAM, an nVidia 6600GT and a Creative SB0230 Sound Card. I think my uncle John wanted the video card, but everything else is up for grabs. My brother's offering me $50 for the motherboard with the CPU, which is ridiculous (I hope you're reading this Scott).

At the moment only one of the four "computers" in my room is operational, and that's my laptop. Tomorrow's going to be fun. Goodbye weekend.
