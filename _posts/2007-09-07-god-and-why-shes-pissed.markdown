I was talking to  [url=/images/other/tom.jpg]Tom (file photo)[/url] tonight and the conversation went a bit like this:

[quote="Conversation"](9:15:01 PM) Radar: I AM GOD.
(9:15:36 PM) Tom: no no your not 
(9:15:44 PM) Radar: I like to think I am.
(9:16:04 PM) Radar: Regardless of whether SHE likes it or not.
(9:16:18 PM) Radar: I figure, if Satan is the "Prince of Darkness" and supposed to be opposite to God, then god must be the "Princess"
(9:16:19 PM) Tom: whos she?
(9:16:30 PM) Tom: lol i see 
(9:16:37 PM) Radar: You've been insulting her.
(9:16:39 PM) Radar: She'll be pissed.
(9:16:42 PM) Tom: lol 
(9:16:48 PM) Radar: No wonder why she's smote so many humans.
(9:16:52 PM) Tom: now that's a different way of looking at it [/quote]

Also, you may have seen something about RESTful routes. That's coming later. Also Rails Generators will rock your world. Two blogs coming up in the next week.
