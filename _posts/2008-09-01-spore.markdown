Current brain cycle:

1. Think about playing Spore.
2. Be envious Darrel (mum's boyfriend) currently possesses copy of Spore sitting on kitchen bench. He's giving it to his son tomorrow.
3. Think about making deal with Darrel about letting me play it and giving my copy (that I'm getting tomorrow) to his son tomorrow.
4. Repeat.
