Rails 2.0 Preview Release 1 was released a couple of days ago. The original idea was of this post to go through all the changelogs and find out all the stuff I thought was cool and list it here. The problem is that there's too much cool stuff. [url=http://blog.rubyonrails.org/2007/9/30/rails-2-0-0-preview-release]DHH summed it up quite nicely.[/url]

My favourites are:
1. has_one and has_many for restful routes. For example, [term]map.resources :forums, :has_many => :topics[/term].
2. Sexy migrations.
3. The way it loads faster, mashing all the javascript/css into one file so it only gets two files (one for js, one for css) instead of 6 or 7.
4. Instead of specifying [term]topic_path(@topic)[/term] for a topics path, now you can do [term]topic_path[/term] and Rails will know what you're talking about.

One thing I'm annoyed at is that routes like [term]forum_edit_topic_path(forum,topic) [/term] to edit a topic now become: [term]edit_forum_topic_path(forum,topic)[/term] Going through each page and finding all the routes that use this will be a pain, and I'm considering making a small ruby script to do it for me.

TOMORROW, I hope to get the LPC report up!
