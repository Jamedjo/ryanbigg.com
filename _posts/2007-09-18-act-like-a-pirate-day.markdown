Me speech be:
Ahoy landlubbers! Yesserday me and my crew wrought the mother 'o' all tests, Aye, she was a beauty to behold. The controller tests were 'ardly a worthy adversary and I slayed them with me keyboard! Yarrr!

When the sun was high, Firs' Maaate Adam reported some of the lubberly model tests were planning a mutiny! They fought well but by sundown their numbers were just two <insert hearty pirate laugh> Arr! The cowardly dogs retreated but we anticipate they be back today! A fight to behold it will be! Afterwards me and my crew will gather a motherload of grog and booty and sail off into the sunset!

Yarrrr! 

Me second mate's speech be:

Ahoy! Arr! Las' nigh me and my crew were attacked by the scurvy seadog Vehicle Price Breaks and his seawench Logic! Thi' here scribble <point to ye whiteboarde> shows the seawench is both a sight to behold and a fearsome foe! Yar...

Me and First Mate Ryan will show ye Skipper our loot and he shall gaze upon it with amazement! The skipper will ask intricate questions to which we shall reply in complex convoluted answers. Skipper will stroke his beard muterring "Yar..." in approval. After a hard day's work, I gather me some grog and sail back to me loves.
