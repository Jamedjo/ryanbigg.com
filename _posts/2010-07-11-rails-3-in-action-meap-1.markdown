Last night whilst I was sleeping (something I do regularly during the night), the first release of the new Rails 3 in Action book took place! You <s>can</s> <strong>will</strong> go out and <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>grab yourself a copy now</a>. Please?

It's been a fun process writing the book so far. I've got a couple of very dedicated people helping me and it's definitely the people who have made the process what it's been. Currently I'm working on Chapter 7 which should be "finished" sometime this afternoon and then I'll begin on Chapter 8 which I hope to have finished by next weekend.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, words of encouragement, professions of love or otherwise, you can write about them on the <a href='http://www.manning-sandbox.com/forum.jspa?forumID=541'>book's forum</a> and I'll reply as soon as I can.

Thanks for supporting me so far!
