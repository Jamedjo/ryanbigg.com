Nicholas Meyler spammed the Ruby community as a whole last year. He was unrepentant for contacting me a second time after I asked him to take me off his list the first time. He holds the #1 rank on [recruiterspam.com](http://recruiterspam.com), and with very good reason. I also had this to say about him:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/rerouse">@rerouse</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/coreyhaines">@coreyhaines</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt">@garybernhardt</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/tenderlove">@tenderlove</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a> Ugh, Nicholas Meyler.

More recently, I re-joined LinkedIn and because LinkedIn asks you to contact with people who you've got email correspondence with, Nicholas Meyler got added to my LinkedIn network by mistake. Apparently this means [that I want us to be friends](http://www.recruitingblogs.com/profiles/blogs/so-now-you-want-to-be-friends?xg_source=activity) (edit: Nicholas has since deleted the blog post [but there's a mirror here](http://i.imgur.com/VKMfhkl.png)). This is not the case.

Here's a reply to that blog post which I would post as a comment, but nobody with any sense reads comments on the internet these days:

Hello! I am the person who called our good friend Nicholas the "scummiest scumbag recruiter ever". It would seem our good friend Nicholas fails to understand the word "libel", which is defined in my dictionary here as "a published false statement that is damaging to a person's reputation". I'd like to focus at the moment on the word "false" here. In my experience with recruiters, Nicholas is the absolute worse of the worst. Allow me to explain.

Let's start with Gary Bernhardt's [open letter to the people at wdsearch.com](https://gist.github.com/garybernhardt/6819142). In this, there are some great indications of the poor practices put in place by Nicholas when attempting to recruit for a job almost a year ago.

On the site recruiterspam.com, [Nicholas Meyler is the spammiest recruiter, ever](http://imgur.com/9VhAR6F). As you can see from the chart, there are quite a lot of recruiters out there, and Nicholas features a lot in that graph. How come? Perhaps it was because Nicholas chose to spam the *entire Ruby community* looking for people to fill positions. Perhaps it was because he was unrepentant when told in very certain terms that unsolicited blanket contacting about recruiting shows a lack of care for the people who he's contacting.

In my opinion, recruiting should be more than about putting bums on seats. It should be about developing connections with people at companies looking to hire people and also connections with the people looking for work. This way, you get to understand the needs of those companies as well as the hires. Treating people like cattle is extremely demeaning and shows a complete lack of empathy. The only other types of people I know to treat people like that are sociopaths.

Recruiters need to focus on the human element of their job, given that is entirely the point: connecting people with other people to build great teams.

Nicholas's accusation of my "scummiest scumbag recruiter ever" comment being libel, is actually provably false. The statement is nothing but the truth, as I have proven, and Nicholas deserves the comment more than anybody else that I can think of right now.

No, Nicholas. I don't want to be friends. I hope that this blog post is another entry into the Google results for your name. The "vandalism" of your name is warranted because of your sheer stubbornness to change your ways for the better. The provocation for the comments was the not once, but *twice*, unsolicited, untargeted email sent to both of my main inboxes. 

You can complain to Google and government all you want. At the end of the day, freedom of speech is still a thing. At the end of your post, you ask for suggestions. I have one: stop being a scumbag recruiter. Work within the communities that you're trying to recruit for and find out who's hiring and who's looking.

Update: Nicholas Meyler has now spammed the support@spreecommerce.com email address with accusations that I am stalking and spamming him. He claims to have reported both myself and Spree Commerce as a company to the FBI and the Australian Government. As I said earlier in this post, I *accidentally* added him on LinkedIn. I email a lot of people and a lot of people email me. He got caught in that dragnet and somehow assumed that I wanted to be friends with him. It's as untrue now as it is was then.

[Here's a copy of the email he sent to the support address](https://gist.github.com/radar/562fd7d870974464f494). He claims that my LinkedIn request was spam. Clearly, it was not. The whole point of LinkedIn is to get, well, "linked in". You do that by sending messages to people asking to connect. He could've ignored the message, but he chose to reply. He is very clearly attempting to rouse me to reply in an aggressive tone with his reply to my automated message, and that's precisely what he got back.

As for the stalking, I was curious about the Google results he mentioned in the LinkedIn contact, so Google'd for his name and didn't find anything of the sort, until down the page in the 6th and 7th results on Google, which are both Gists:

![Gists](http://i.imgur.com/pYilCUJ.png)

The [Gist by Gary Bernhardt](https://gist.github.com/garybernhardt/6819142) I've already linked to in this post, but [DHH's is just as good](https://gist.github.com/dhh/7226428). Nicholas Meyler attempted to recruit the guy who created Rails for a Rails job. DHH is actually pretty gainfully employed, and so I don't understand why Nicholas Meyler would contact him unless it wasn't a blanket, unsolicited spamming of the Ruby community.

During my Googling I also found [Nicholas Meyler's RecruiterBlogs profile](http://www.recruitingblogs.com/profile/NicholasMeyler), and the most recent post then was the post that caused this post to happen. The only points of contact that I've had with the guy are: 1) I replied back to his message on LinkedIn with "Do kindly fuck right off." 2) I commented on his blog with a link to this blog post 3) I emailed wdsearch.com with a link to this blog post, thinking his colleagues -- if they are indeed real people, which I strongly doubt but thought I'd try on the off chance anyway -- would enjoy the post.

Other than that, I have not done anything that would even come close to constitute as "stalking". To accuse me of such a terrible thing really is sinking to new lows and really is showing the depravity of Nicholas Meyler. Stalking is quite a serious offence and I honestly have better things to do with my time than obsess over one scumbag recruiter for any period of time longer than it takes to write a blog post or two.

Nicholas Meyler needs to give up and get back to doing what he does best. Surely the man has more important things to do than to harrass me and my employer.
