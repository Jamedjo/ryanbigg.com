title: Rails 3.1 in Action
---

I'm edging ever closer to finishing Rails 3 in Action with only 3 and a half chapters remaining (_Translations_, _Background Jobs_, _Alternative Authentication_ and _Mounting Rack Applications_ being the half). I'm hoping to knock them off on the next couple of weeks and then the book will be (besides the appendicies) content complete! Finally.

So I think now is a good time to announce my next book: tentatively called _Rails 3.1 in Action_. This book will contain the same content as Rails 3 in Action but will be specifically directed at people who are running Rails 3.1 rather than Rails 3.0 and so some of the content will be modified to accommodate these changes. The main changes of this will be the moving of the _Engines_ and _Mounting Rack Applications_ chapters from _Rails 3 in Action_ into _Rails 3.1 in Action_, basically because Rails 3.0 doesn't have the necessary features to accommodate the awesome things these chapters do, where Rails 3.1 does. Another change is the updating of Chapter 8 from using Prototype (eeew) to jQuery (yaaaay). If you have bought copies of these chapters for _Rails 3 in Action_ we ask kindly that you return them (the chapters, you can keep the rest of the book) and wait until _Rails 3.1 in Action_ comes out with the updated copies.

Manning, Yehuda, our reviewers and I have been talking about the best way to accommodate the readers who have 3.0 applications as well as 3.1 applications (soon enough, this will be the case) and we have decided the best way is to split it out into another book. Rather than have a _2nd edition_ released so close to the first edition, we're going to give this book another name to clearly differentiate it between the original (and quite clearly, the best) Rails 3 book.

The day that Rails 3.1 is released is the same day you can expect to be able to visit your nearest bookshop and purchase this new installment of the _Rails X in Action_ series.

Thanks for your support, purchases, comments and praise so far. It really helps!
