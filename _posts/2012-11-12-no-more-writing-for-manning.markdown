title: No more writing for Manning
---

As of around this time last week, I am no longer writing for Manning.

This decision has been a long time coming. Ever since I started working for
Manning I've had issues with their tooling. I covered these in posts like ["Don't print
hard-copies"](http://ryanbigg.com/2011/11/don-t-print-hard-copies/) and ["The
Writing Process"](http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/the-writing-process/)).
They've been saying now for *two years* that they were going to fix it and...
nothing much has been done.

I got so frustrated with their system two weeks in, I decided to write my own.
I demonstrate part of Manning's system and part of my own, in [this short
video](https://vimeo.com/45002976). I wrote my own review system in
a relatively short period of time.

The writing tools are something that I need to use everyday and if they're just
getting in my way, it totally kills my vibe to write. I don't want to hate
writing, because I *love* writing. I love the feeling I get when I can clearly
explain something to someone the first time in writing and they just *get it*.

So, no more writing for Manning because their tools for doing it are terrible.
The people at Manning are nothing short of excellent.

Rails 4 in Action *will* be published by Manning -- they have the rights to the
book, not me -- meaning they will need to source another author to do it. For
any questions related to that process, contact <a 
href='support@manning.com'>support@manning.com</a>. They'll know more about it
than I do.

All of that doesn't mean I've stopped writing Rails material completely. Oh no no no. You just wait.
