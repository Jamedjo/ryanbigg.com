title: They fixed the keyboard

Consider this post a sequel to my <a href='https://ryanbigg.com/2019/08/can-apple-please-design-a-laptop-that-has-a-functional-keyboard-for-the-love-of-all-that-is-precious'>
The 2018 MacBook Pro Keyboard Drives Me Crazy
(Aug '19)</a> post from earlier in the year.

In that post, I listed the following complaints about the 2018 MacBook Pro keyboard:

> * duplicated "o's" that I've had to go back and fix, or missing ones -- guess how fun it is to write [a book about a Toy Robot](https://leanpub.com/elixir-toyrobot) with this particular problem
> * double spaces -- or no spaces
> * a Command key that registers 9 out of every 10 times
> * words like "times" that inexplicably get spelled like "timies", or "about" that gets spelled like "abouot"

I've now been using a brand-new 2019 MacBook Pro for about 5 hours and I've been using the keyboard _extensively_ during the setup of this machine.

Those complaints that I had above? They don't exist on this keyboard. There has been no duplicated letters, spaces, dodgy Command keys, or mispelled words that were not my clumsiness.

I've _felt_ more productive on this keyboard since I got it. I'm guessing because I didn't have to go back and fix up so many mistakes.

But I wanted to get quantifiable data on this, and given that I _type for a living_ what better way to do this than to run a few tests.

So I went over to [TypeRacer](https://typeracer.com) on my _old_ MacBook Pro and scored in the 95-105WPM range over 5 tests.

Then I went to TypeRacer on my _new_ MacBook Pro and did 5 more tests.

My range there was 105-120WPM. So I'm typing at about 15-20WPM _on average_ faster on this keyboard than I was on the old one.

This keyboard _is_ better for me than the old one was. It seems that Apple has fixed the keyboard issues.

Bravo.
