title: The 2018 MacBook Pro Keyboard Drives Me Crazy
---

I recently upgraded from a 2015 MacBook Pro to a 2018 MacBook Pro. And by
"recently", I mean back at the start of June. I wanted a new MacBook Pro because of the faster performance that a new computer would give me. Work (Culture Amp) was also upgrading their fleet of Macs and I was one of the lucky people to get a new one.

So I've been using this computer as a work computer for almost 3 months now and, my god, the keyboard _drives me mental_. Even writing this blog post now on the train and there's:

* duplicated "o's" that I've had to go back and fix, or missing ones -- guess how fun it is to write [a book about a Toy Robot](https://leanpub.com/elixir-toyrobot) with this particular problem
* double spaces -- or no spaces
* a Command key that registers 9 out of every 10 times
* words like "times" that inexplicably get spelled like "timies", or "about" that gets spelled like "abouot"

Apple is _all about_ the thinness of their laptops. I do not particularly care about the thinness of this device. For the most part, it sits on one of two desks that I use or it sits on my lap on the train. _Maybe_ I use it on the couch from time-to-time. I do not care about the thinness of this device _while I am using it_. I only care about it when I store it away, in my backpack.

This keyboard has a key travel distance that, I am sure, is measured in microns or perhaps nanometers. It feels like I am typing on a concrete slab. Key presses inexplicably duplicate. Or don't register at all. All for _thinness_.

This keyboard is a catastrophic engineering failure, designed by a company that should know better. A company with more money in the bank than several countries _combined_. This keyboard would be, by far, the part of the MacBook Pro that is used the _most_ by everybody who owns one, and it is so poorly engineered for the pursuit of _thinness_.

Apple _must_ fix this problem in their upcoming MacBook Pro releases. I want a _fat_ MacBook pro keyboard, one that has a travel distance of the older wireless keyboards and doesn't have that "concrete slab" feel. I want to be able to type _an entire paragraph_ without having to go back and correct things because the keyboard failed.

I am tired of having to correct what I type because of this keyboard's faults. I am tired of having to use external keyboards to actually _enjoy_ using this computer. I love the Mac and it's software and how things _just_ work. But I will leave if this keyboard farce continues.

If Apple releases their new Macs with an _identical_ keyboard, then I'm ditching Macs and will pick up a Microsoft Surface Book or something similar. Whatever it is, I'll make sure to pick a laptop that has _a god damned functional keyboard_.
