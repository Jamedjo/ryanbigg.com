I have opened up comments to the general public at the bequest of Ralxz. No more do you need to look for the non-existent register link to post a comment, just specify your name and a message when you post a comment. Don't be surprised if it doesn't come up instantly, I (with a little help from Akismet) moderate all the comments on the site.
