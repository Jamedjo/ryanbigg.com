So like all of like yesterday I was like doing work at like work and I was like working on like ticket printing and I like managed to like use like four like hundred tickets just to like get the positioning like right.

Now if I continued this blog post doing that it would get annoying, not only for me but for people who wasted their time reading all the "like"s.

The whole point of this blog post is to rant about how people, especially women (I'm not being sexist), pepper their sentences with the word "like" as a verbal filler, like the loud, fat woman on the train this afternoon.

"Hey honey, would you like to do that thing we did last week?" ("legal" usage)
"You know, like, what Scott and I did last week?" ("illegal" usage)
"Yeah, like we went out on the town and like drunk lots and then we like went to a hotel and like stayed the night" (No she didn't get a triple word score for this)

Then my personal favourite:

"You know what I'm saying?"

I twitched, or was it more like a spasm? Or maybe a mini-seizure, not sure.

"Yeah! <insert pig laughter here> Like totally!"

Another twitch.

"Then like we can like go to the like Casino and like gamble and like stuff."

This continued for the whole train journey.

Please, for the love of God. Do not pepper your sentences with "like". It is a waste of breath, and a waste of time for whoever has to listen to your nonsense.
