For this project at work we made a "pact" not to cut our hair or trim our beards until the project end, unknown at this point, assuming by the end of my contract (4th Dec, my birthday). So I thought. The other day the boss, Adam, walks in with a shorter haircut than the day previous. I make an objection and he says it was never part of "the rules" and everyone else agrees with him. So I decided I would get my hair cut. 

The last time I had my hair cut was around the time Shrek 3 was just coming out (late May, I think).  So it's been a while. I let it get this far:

That's probably the longest I've ever had it. I was starting to look like one of the Beatles. Tonight was "late-night shopping" so I got my hair cut down to:

That's a weight off my shoulders.
