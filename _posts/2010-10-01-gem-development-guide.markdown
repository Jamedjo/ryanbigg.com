From <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/advanced-rails-documentation/">my request yesterday</a> asking people what Rails documentation would be valuable, a large group of respondents said they'd like to see a guide on how to develop a gem. As I figured this would only take me two days to write and would be a good way to promote <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>a certain book</a>, I've begun writing one which I should have finished by tonight with only generators and releasing to cover.

You <a href='http://github.com/radar/guides/blob/master/gem-development.md'>can see it here</a>.

This is the kind of guide I was talking about in yesterday's post. They don't have to be short and they don't have to be long, they just have to be <em>informative</em>. Is this what people would like to see more of? Are the topics I put forward yesterday worthwhile covering or is there something more interesting to the Greater Audience?
