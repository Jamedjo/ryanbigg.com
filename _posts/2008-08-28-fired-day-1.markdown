Yesterday I was given my two weeks notice by my boss, he cited personality issues. I had posts on this website explaining my side of the story and why I felt the way I did, but I have chosen to take them down on the advice that it may cost me future employment and that it also may land me in legal "hot water". What can you say these days without getting in trouble?

I planned on riding Adelaide to Elizabeth again today. Had a meeting with the SeaLink guys about Railscamp #4 sponsorship instead and did four laps of lake torrens on my bike before the right pedal on my bike came loose.

Time to chill.
