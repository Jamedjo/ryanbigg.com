Valhalla is a non-profit LAN party ran by a group of volunteers every 6-8 weeks at the St. Clair's Recreation Centre in Woodville. This LAN party was slightly different due to the fact it was held on Court four instead of the main three courts in the Recreation Centre. This meant that the LAN had only a capacity of 180 people, but had a very nice atmosphere.

At the May Event, competitions ranged from Call of Duty 2 (5v5) to CounterStrike:Source, both on the PC, to Tekken 5 on the PS3, (pictured below).

One of these competitions was the Adrenalin Challenge. The Adrenalin Challenge is a challenge held by sponsors of the event and it can be for any game on any map. This event, it was for Medal of Honor:Allied Assault. The Adrenalin team chose the Nazi side and their job was to defend the cannons on top of the bunkers from the Allies, the lanners, who's job it was to destroy those cannons. It was tough, and lots of people complained (even me a few hundred times) and rage-quitted, but it was eventually won by Hell Rok, [s]a cheating scumbag[/s], a very lucky person who picked himself up a new 8600GT.

All in all, good times were had, and I'm looking forward to the next event.

Also, RadarLAN is on the Queen's Birthday weekend (whenever that is), it's on a Friday or Saturday night, and more details will be put up once Coles actually answers their damn phones.
