Well, I'll assume it was two. Some idiot(s) in the middle of the night smashed the corner of my back-right window and rifled through my car looking for something. Obviously they didn't find it because the car is still there. They changed the gearstick to reverse, took off the handbrake and moved an American flag I had in the boot into the backseat (I know! The outrage!). Everything's still in the car, just in more disarray than usual.
