Matt Lightner -- <a href='http://www.facebook.com/mlightner'>according to posts on his Facebook</a> -- is dead. It apparently
happened on Christmas day, which just adds supremely to the suckiness of it all.

You may remember him from that little hosting company called <a href='http://site5.com'>Site5</a> he started when he was 15. You know
the one that was one of the, if not *the* first, hosting company to offer Ruby on Rails support.

I had the pleasure of working with Matt around September last year and ended up visiting him in San Francisco. We went to <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz/antonios-nut-house-palo-alto'>Antonio's Nut House</a> where we drank and played darts (and ate way too many free peanuts). Then we went back to his apartment where I got to sleep on an air mattress. That morning we went for bagels at a place not too far away from the Nut House. Those are my favourite memories of San Francisco.

He was such an amazing guy and will be terribly missed.
