After going to Scotland in March and attending the very awesome Scottish Ruby Conference I still feel like travelling. For quite a long time I've wanted to go to San Francisco and check out the Ruby scene there and I also have a couple of people who I'd love to catch up with in other parts of the country. So I'm going to be doing an "American tour".

I'm thinking of flying in on the 15th September, staying for 2 weeks and leaving on the 29th or 30th. So far I've planned as far as attending GoGaRuCo (probably not speaking, unless they want me to) and perhaps spending a day or two in SF going to bug the EngineYard and GitHub guys.

After that? I've got invites to go visit people in Indiana, Ohio and Florida and so that's what I'll be doing. No specific dates yet, but there's definitely a whole slew of people from the Ruby community who I'd love to meet.

Thanks to the people who have already offered accommodation! In my single overseas trip experience so far, this takes a *lot* of hassle out of doing it!

I'll see you when I get there!
