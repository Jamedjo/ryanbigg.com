title: Adelaide - 2 Degrees of Separation

One thing that apparently struck a lot of people when they came to Adelaide for Railscamp last weekend was how small Adelaide actually is. Over the course of a few months there's been a few instances where I've known people I've spoken with through a very small degree of separation. The three instances that I've encountered this year are:

<ul>
  <li>The guy I hit with my car has a friend who's dad works with my dad</li>
  <li>Yesterday had a barbecue @ James's house and met up with somebody who uses the Netfox product</li>
  <li>At the barbecue also met up with a girl who hangs out with an old childhood friend of mine who I haven't seen in years</li>
</ul>

It amazes me how we're all interconnected somehow.
