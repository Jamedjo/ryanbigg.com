<a href="http://frozenplague.net/2008/01/10/job-advertisements/">Last week I posted about a job advertisement I dissected and picked at on the Ruby on Rails mailing-list</a> and now I'm happy to bring you another dissection direct from a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/2948802cc56e6de7">job advertisement for a nameless large financial company based in Manhattan.</a>

I take much joy in writing these and I feel a sense of irony that I should be reading job advertisements (I'm out of one next week) and yet I'm picking them apart.

Also on the job front my friend Paul, whom I met back in Ye Olde TAFE days has finally got a real job (he's only had one other job I know of, and that was cleaning dishes at Charlies). In light of this momentous occasion, the world has announced it will be ending on Monday 28th January 2008 at 9am Australian Central Standard Time. There will be free headless horsemen and enternal damnation for all. Afterwards, there shall be cake. Delicious, moist cake.

Entirely coincidentally, <a href="http://www.telstra.com.au/cdmaupgrade/index.htm">Telstra will be shutting down their CDMA network</a> on the same day.
