## The "D" word

We have a diversity problem in the community, and that's been talked about
quite a lot when it comes to _tangible_ things like gender and race. A
diversity of skill -- an _intangible_ thing -- is also something we struggle
with. Our companies are very senior-heavy, and our thirst for hiring seniors is
unquenchable.

When I started out as a Rails developer in 2006, I was tinkering around with
the framework in my spare time, which I had a lot of because I was single and
working casually at Coles (the big-red-supermarket chain) in Australia and
doing the odd spot of PHP freelancing. I did the freelancing because the Coles
work was very casual and low-paying. In 2006, freelancing at $50 an hour felt
like I was, as they say, "making it rain".

One day, I heard that there was a Ruby meetup happening in Adelaide and I
caught the train into town and _ran_ to the meetup because I was running very
late.

When I got there, there was about 10 or 15 people there. This was 2007 and
Rails was still "underground", which is to say only the ultra-cool people knew
about Rails. All the ultra-cool Rails hackers were there. Those ultra-cool
Rails hackers asked what I did and I told them about Coles, PHP and Rails.
They said "you don't need to work for Coles or write PHP anymore" and three
people gave me their business cards and said I should apply for a job. I
applied for a job at SeaLink -- a travel company that runs a ferry between the
mainland and Kangaroo Island -- and was accepted almost immediately.

At SeaLink, I got mentored by a team of "senior" Rails developers who had a
whole bunch of patience for my 19-year-old antics. You know that thing where
19-year-olds think they know everything? Yeah, that was me. And I got angry, a
lot too.

And by "senior" Rails developers I mean that these developers had two years
worth of experience whereas I had about 6 months. I am very thankful to them
for the time that they spent mentoring me, as I believe it helped provide a
foundation for a career that I've been doing for very close to 10 years. I
haven't had to work a single day more at Coles or with PHP ever since and for
both of those things I am eternally grateful.

In those early days of Rails when only ultra-cool hackers knew the framework,
there was a lack of available talent and so companies had to hire whoever they
could find. "Beggars can't be choosers" and all that. That's why I found it
easy to get a Rails job back then. There wasn't a pool of seniors to poach
from, so they had to hire anyone they could get. Including 19-year-old, knows-
everything-but-is-angry-about-it me.

But now there's a large amount of super-ultra-cool people who know Ruby and
Rails (P.S. that's you), and so we as a community have employed pretty much
all of them. There's now a different issue: there just isn't enough senior
developers to go around. Economics 101 calls this type of problem "supply and
demand" and you've _probably_ already heard of that.

Companies want to grow their development teams -- by putting on more senior
developers -- but are currently finding it hard to hire seniors because all
the seniors are already working at other companies. There is a ton of demand,
but very little supply. Everyone you'd want to hire already has extremely
well-paying, cushy jobs.

To try to coax senior developers away from those jobs, their ping pong tables,
their beer fridges, their free food, their free gym memberships... is an
exercise in futility.

The modus operandi of the community is unsustainable, as evidenced by how
bloody hard it is to hire someone these days. So how on earth are we supposed
to grow our companies if we can't keep poaching developers from other places?

The fix is to hire and train up juniors to be the next generation of best-and-
brightest developers. The seniors that exist in the community here-and-now are
here because at one point in the past, someone gave them an opportunity.
SeaLink gave me my opportunity way back in 2007.

We need to give more opportunities to juniors in this community and to educate
the next generation of awesome developers.

Asim Aslam (@chuhnk) had a good tweet (now deleted, but kept here for posterity) about this too:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When hiring remember that someone once gave you an opportunity when you didn&#39;t have the experience. Hire smart raw talent and mentor them.</p>&mdash; Asim Aslam (@chuhnk) <a href="https://twitter.com/chuhnk/status/720756690493259777">April 14, 2016</a></blockquote>

This will grow the community, replenish the talent pool and allow
us to continue to thrive as an industry.

## The Mid-to-Senior Addiction

The issue with that is not many people want to hire juniors in the first
place.

Instead, these companies want to hire mid-to-senior developers and do not want
to have juniors who are learning alongside those mid-to-senior developers. This
is that unquenchable thirst that I was talking about earlier. We have to ship
things _fast_ and mentoring juniors means that we take time away from actually
shipping things. Shipping things fast is the sacred cow of most software
companies. Anything that hurts "shipping things fast" is taboo. But what if I
was to tell you that mentoring juniors meant that you could ship things faster?
Weird, I know. But hear me out.

It's pretty strange that we, the people who get the computers to do the hard
thinking, can't find time to mentor a junior. We're too busy shipping things.
We'll hire a junior when we're not as busy. Oh the lies we tell ourselves.

Why are we too busy? What's the rush? If we don't deliver these five features
and fix these three bugs by Friday, is our company going to go down in flames?
Not usually. There are plenty of companies here who have been here for the
long-term now, and who will probably be here for just as long again. The busy-
ness will not change. Work is like a gas: it fills any and all available time.
The work is always present, but the people who do the work are not going to
be. People leave: they change jobs, professions, countries and lifestyles. Or
sometimes they just plain ol' die.

So how do we prepare for people leaving our companies as a community to ensure
the long-term viability of what we're doing?

Other professions, like lawyers, mechanics, teachers and plenty of others
recognise that the people who are doing the work today aren't going to be doing
the work forever. These professions have active apprenticeship efforts, where
these apprentices then usually go on to become the next generation of lawyers,
mechanics, teachers or whatever else.

But why don't many companies that employ programmers do this? Why are we too
busy, but lawyers aren't? Have you _seen_ what kind of hours lawyers put in?
Have you never watched Suits, which of course is a 100% true-to-fact TV show
about lawyering? Fun fact: Lawyers are probably the only profession that
charges more than Ruby developers.

I think that other professions are not junior-adverse because those
professions have had turnover in their companies enough to learn the lesson
about training for the future. They have reached the point that we're at now
where there just isn't enough "senior" lawyers, mechanics or teachers to go
around and so they start hiring _and training_ new talent. Lawyering, I can
guarantee you, is an older-than-your-grandfather profession. Programming on
the other hand, isn't (yet).

The principal running the school your kid goes to realises that the teachers
they have aren't going to be around forever. This is because teachers are not
yet solar-powered automatons. They hire these young upstarts from universities,
like my wife, to be the teachers of the future.

The grizzled mechanic that fixes your car for the last decade has saved his
pennies and is retiring off the coast of Australia on his catamaran. Davy, the
best young mechanic he has, is the one who will run the shop once ol'
grizzle-face is gone. Grizzle-face reckons she'll do, and I quote: "a bang up
job. She'll be right mate."

This Ruby community is still a young community where most people have been
doing this Ruby thing for less than 15 years. That's less than a generation.
If Rails was a person, that person would not even be old enough to have
graduated high-school, let alone make adult decisions. This is reflected
somewhat in the design choices of the framework, but that's a conversation for
another day.

We must make our succession plans to ensure the long-term viability of this
community. Other professions have succession plans because they've lived long
enough to realise that having them is the sensible thing to do. I strongly feel
like we are at that point now, or at least the cusp of it.

This emphasis on shipping things faster and "delivering value" is short-term
enough to be frustrating. The companies we're building and the code we're
writing will last longer than a month or two... usually. So we need to think
more long-term than shipping fast. For instance, Culture Amp -- the company I
work for -- has existed for 6 years. Who's to say it won't exist for another 6?

What we really need to think about is: who will look after the code that powers
our companies a year, or five years from now?  How do we ensure the long-term
survivability of our companies, and our community as a whole? What is our
succession plan? I'll answer these in a moment.

## Hiring seniors

But first, let's look at why companies want to hire mid-seniors in the first
place. At the companies I've worked at, we've wanted to hire a new
mid-to-senior person because our workload has gotten to the point where it's
exceeding our capacity. I figure that this is the same at other companies too.
Tons of companies are hiring at the moment for this very reason.

To address this problem, you hire a new developer or rather: you try to hire a
new developer. You want a mid-to-senior developer because they have the skills
to instantly dive straight into your application with little-to-no guidance and
they can start shipping code. That old expression: "they can hit the ground
running". This is because your code is so brillianly well-structured and
organised according to the Rails best practices and nobody will have to upskill
on any single part of the codebase at all because you all follow the Laws of
Sandi and Commandments of Avdi to the letter. There is no legacy code with their
legacy decisions, written in a hurry because you needed to ship that thing
_fast_. HA.

However: the trick is finding someone who's available at the moment. In this
current climate, it's nearly impossible to hire a mid-to-senior Ruby developer
to come work for your company. What typically happens is that developers get
aggressively poached between companies. The salary and other bonuses are off
the charts. Just one example of how off the charts it is: There was a
not-so-big tech company in LA advertising for a mid-to-senior Rails developer
for a base rate of $230k, and that's US dollars. Amazon, Google and Facebook
offer even more than this, with offers from $250k+ being common. To put it in
perspective: the average wage in the US is $81,400, and so that job was roughly
3x that amount. It's just ludicrous.

Companies spend thousands of dollars on recruiters and lots of time posting to
job boards, for often very little good return. Companies spend this money to
hunt the elusive 10x Developer Rockstar Unicorns (note: term used ironically),
but the Unicorns are no longer out grazing in the sunny meadows, readily
available for capture.  They're already working somewhere else and the
conditions of where they work are extremely competitive. To keep with the
analogy: the meadows are filled with the greenest of grasses and the brightest
of rainbows. You will have a hard time luring these unicorns away.

We're out of freely available Rockstar Unicorns because they're already
employed elsewhere and so it's time that we started to grow our own. It's time
that we started to hire and train our own 10x Developer Rockstar Unicorns.

Companies are addicted to hiring the top 5% or 10% of developers and ignoring
the rest. There is a lot of great talent in the remaining group of developers,
just waiting to be mentored. If they got that mentorship, we would be able to
bolster our community's best and brightest. What if the next person your
company mentored went on to become your next CTO? What if they went on to be
that "10x engineer" who can help out anyone on the team with anything? I
really believe companies are missing out on great talent by completely
ignoring it when it is non-obvious.

## Skill diversity is a boon to your team

Companies are hiring the best-of-the-best -- the people with _proven_ great
track records working at other companies previously -- and getting them to
build what is essentially CRUD applications which do, at best, a fancy version
of string concatenation and database manipulation.

If we compare this to musicians: you're hiring the Beyonces, Kanyes and Ricks
and getting them to sing _Mary Had A Little Lamb_. Imma let you finish, but
this isn't a great tactic overall.

This talent pool, as we're finding out, is not limitless.

Piling a bunch of senior developers into a room together isn't going to
produce the next big hit. It may work for the music industry, but in the Land
of Programming it is very different. Skill diverse teams perform better.

But don't just take my word for it. Google ran a project called Project
Aristotle which looked into what makes teams great. The initial thinking was
that if you got a bunch of utterly brilliant developers in a room together and
put them to task to solve a Very Hard Problem that they would knock it out of
the park because of their sheer brilliance. Their research proved this
assumption very wrong. What the research showed was that a skill-diverse team
_always_ performed better than a team of brilliant minds. And not only that,
but a gender-diverse team performed better than one that was either all-male
_or_ all-female. The best teams were the ones that were diverse across all the
regular metrics: gender, age and race, as well as skill. Google, as usual, has
all the answers.

So when we hire all the brilliant developers we can get our hands on, we're
doing our companies a disservice. We're filling ourselves full-to-the-brim of
brilliant minds, and that, at least according to Google's research, isn't a
healthy thing to do. The healthy thing to do is to include people of a diverse
skill-level, who are not all male, and who are not all between the age bracket
of 20-35, and who are not all white.

You may think that you need to hire these best-of-the-best badasses because
your application is a large unmaintable behemoth monolith and only the badasses
can understand it. That you need seniors to navigate the spaghetti that is your
legacy code. Maybe you use technologies that only _true_ geniuses can
understand. All because you didn't listen to Sandi or Avdi.

That may indeed be the case. After all, if our code was simple and elegant,
would as many of us still be employed? But in every monolith, there is a small
bit of functionality that a junior developer can work on improving along with
their skills, when that junior is paired with a senior developer. The juniors
can practice their skills by fixing bugs and working with the senior to
develop features. This is the way we grow them into the next generation.

After all, senior devs don't grow on trees, you must give juniors a chance.
Don't take just my word for this either. Here's a tweet from 4 years ago too:

https://mobile.twitter.com/buritica/status/492807632659689472

## Hiring juniors at Culture Amp

With even a few months worth of training, these developers can be productive. I
know that juniors can be productive, because we're making it happen at Culture
Amp.

In October 2016, we hired Lauren Hennessy, who is now a very productive member
of one of our teams. She has even started mentoring juniors herself, as a
mid-level developer. She was also someone who became President of Ruby
Australia based solely on the political campaign of "fuck it, why not?" -- and
then she did a marvellous job at that too. She did this because she was given an opportunity.

In May 2017, we hired Ramya Ravindranath, a timid junior developer with such an
incredible thirst for self-improvement and knowledge. One day, I was trying to
explain `git checkout` to Ramya, and I was doing a terrible job at it. So I
linked her to the Git Book chapter on `checkout`. The next day, she just
casually mentions to me that she squashed and rebased a few commits. She jumped
from `git checkout` to `git rebase` in _one day_. More recently, she led
development efforts on a GraphQL application we were developing. She did the
research into GraphQL and worked with other members of her team to build it.
She did that because she was given an opportunity.

Then, at the end of November, we hired another 5 juniors and spun up the first
ever Culture Amp Junior Engineering Program to provide structured training for
them, over the course of 6 months. Two days a week, they are doing "program
work" and the other three days they're with their teams. When the 6 months are
up, they'll be fully-fledged developers.

During the program days, we work on little toy projects, learn about how
software is developed in the Real World™. Then on the team days, they apply
this knowledge to solve problems, fix bugs and deliver features.

We hired two students from RMIT, a local university. These people are Rebecca
Vo and Jasmine Ellis. That university was doing a Rails course that these
developers undertook, and so they came to us with some Ruby and Rails
background.

We hired Jaime Terreu from Coder Academy here in Melbourne, which is a 6-month
intensive course on Ruby + Rails. He also knew a bit about Ruby and Rails.

But we didn't just hire people who had done intensive Rails courses. We also
hired two career changers: Julie Huang and Namibia Lebron-Torres. Julie used
to be a photographer and worked at LucasArts on Star Wars Episode 8. The in-
depth research that Julie does on new programming concepts is astounding.

Namibia was a nutritional scientist, applying statistical modelling to
studying how what people eat effected their well-being. The notes that Namibia
keeps while she's learning are exceptionally detailed and should be compiled
into a book for other junior developers to learn from.

All five of our new hires have a great tenacity for learning, which I think is
the best quality to have as a developer. They may come across something that
they don't know, and each of them will go and try to learn about it. It's so
great to see.

These five come from diverse backgrounds. They all started out knowing
different things about Ruby / Rails that others may have not known. They
complement each other's skills. Each of them has grown an amazing amount over
the last 4 months. Each of them has contributed valuably to Culture Amp during
their time at the company.

My point here is that we've hired people who aren't all white, male, 25-34,
excellent Rails developers and yet... everything is still OK. In fact, it's
better than OK: it's awesome. Our senior developers and junior developers work
together on the team days on our applications and there's not a single fire or
brimstone as far as the eye can see.

I am glad we brought these people on because every single one of them
contributes something valuable back to this wonderful community.

## Contributing back

Now I'm not saying that you should go out, interview 70+ people, interview 16
of them a second time and then hire 5 juniors from that bunch. Culture Amp is
a huge company and so we have a lot of structure and processes in place to do
that hiring and support these juniors once we hire them. It's why we're able
to mentor 8 of them at the time and still ship features and "deliver customer
value".

What I'm suggesting is that your company should hire at least one junior and
mentor them. If your company is at least 5 developers and at least one of them
wants to mentor, you can hire and support a junior. You should try to hire one
junior for every 5 non-junior members of your team. This will lead to a
greater skill-diversity in your team, and Google's Project Aristotle tells us
that this makes teams more productive, so you should definitely follow their
advice.

Your next question might be: "what do _we_ (as a company) get out of hiring a
junior?" I think that's backwards. The thinking should be "we have earned so
much from the community, and now it's time to give back". "Ask what you can do
for your [community]" and all that. We have benefited from this community and
culture for over a decade now. To ensure the long-term viability of this great
Ruby community we have for at least another decade, we need to train up the
next generation. If you invest in the long term health of the community, it
will pay even greater dividends than what we have reaped already. In the long
run, you will have people who you have trained up specifically to work on your
application and who have the knowledge and skills to teach other people. In
the short term, you'll be bolstering your team's productivity with fresh
talent, ensuring the sustainability of your company over the long term.

### Risks

When I talk to people about hiring juniors, there's two main problems that they raise:

* What if we train them up and they leave?
* Won't this lead to a productivity hit?

So what if you do train them up and then they leave? That's a risk you take with
any hire of any skill level. If people are leaving your company, you should be
reflecting on why they're leaving in the first place. Was it really them, or
was it your company? Does your company have a culture that someone would want
to leave? Is your company focussed on building a culture that people want to
stay in? Is your company actively developing its people _and_ its software? Or
are they only interested in shipping code? What are you doing to make them stay?

To the second point of the productivity hit, that is an unavoidable truth.
Your team will be _less_ productive once a junior joins it. There is an
initial productivity hit -- that's true -- but that plateaus out within 6
months if you do it right. We've found that to be true for Lauren and Ramya at
least, who have now been at the company for 18 months and 10 months
respectively.

Investing in a junior is investing in their future potential; their future
productivity. And by "future potential" I don't mean what they give back to
your company. I mean what they can give back to the community during their
entire career. You can give them that career kickstart. To quote a line from
one of the best movies of all time, Hot Fuzz: It's "for the greater good."

At Culture Amp, I would consider all the juniors to be productive
members of their respective teams, _and_ they're great people to work with to
boot. We would've missed out on these people if we didn't invest the time in
hiring and mentoring them and instead focussed on only hiring seniors who had
existing Rails app development experience.

One more thing: all of the juniors at Culture Amp have mentored our senior
developers on the most important programmer skill: patience. This is the thing
that juniors provide to your team that no senior can do. The seniors must
explain things to a junior, and that takes time. They might even have to
explain things more than once. Patiently explaining something to someone helps
seniors understand their own systems better and, in my extremely scientific
opinion, makes the seniors much better developers than if they only had to
explain things to other seniors. They need to slow down and methodically
explain things, which helps solidify the senior's knowledge.

Patience is a virtue that more developers should learn. The ironic thing about
me saying this is that I'm a naturally impatient person (just ask anyone who's
known me for more than 5 minutes)... who's getting more patient because of the
mentoring I'm doing. Huh, maybe it works.

At the end of training a junior for 6 months, rather than having one
developer, you have two developers.  Even if the junior is _half_ as
productive as the senior, then it's still a 1.5x growth in the productivity of
your team. If I told you today that you could ship things 1.5x faster in 6
months time with this one weird trick... you'd listen to me. Hiring a junior
is that one weird trick.

And hiring a junior is _so incredibly_ easy right now. But where do you find
these juniors?

## Finding Juniors

Well, let's start with Code Academies and universities.

Code academies get new developers to pay thousands of dollars to learn the
tricks of the trade. Sometimes, these new developers even get a "guarantee"
from the code academy that they'll get a job at the end of the course,
oftentimes that job is with an agency building cookie-cutter CMS-backed sites.
But hey, a job is a job. It's a foot in the door.

The code academies teach these newbies a range of programming skills. At the
end of this, the newbie developers have enough skills to know the basics of
things like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby and Rails and can usually find their way
around a generic Rails app easily enough. These people are very "green" and
then they're thrust out into the community to work at companies.

Unfortunately, due to our senior hiring addiction, we're not hiring many of
these fresh faces. One of the Culture Amp juniors that I mentioned earlier, Jaime, is an
exception. He came from the Coder Academy here in Melbourne.

The code academies are producing brand new talent at a faster rate than we're
hiring. These people are left to struggle for months at a time in developing
their skills before they can even get a look in at a larger, non-agency
company. Our collective bar is too high for these juniors to get a look in.
I've spoken to many juniors in that position. Companies want to hire people
with experience, but they don't want to give them the experience in the first
place. With the talent pool run dry, it's time we started hiring these juniors
and training them up.

Not all of these graduates have the time to spend doing that skill
development, as they often have full time jobs or other responsibilities to
take care of. Thankfully, they get a lot of assistance from their code
academies after they've graduated.

The senior developers of the future are coming from the code academies and
universities of today. More companies need to make mentorship / apprenticeship
a part of what they do. It's vital for the sustainability of the company. The
students that graduate from code academies and universities are eager to learn
and are, in my experience, very highly motivated. We've hired 3 people from
places like this: Jaime, Rebecca and Jasmine. They're great and each brings
their own set of skills to our company.

There are definitely juniors who have that same kind of eagerness-to-learn and
motivation who have never been to a code academy. These people have learned by
themselves and by being mentored by people in the community. Out of the
Culture Amp juniors I mentioned before, two fit this bill: Namibia and Julie.
While they haven't gone through intensive coding schools or universities, they
still bring to Culture Amp a great set of skills that they've built up
themselves. Their ability to learn on their own far exceeds those who have
been classically taught.

We interviewed a bunch of other people who fit this bill and while we didn't
place them at Culture Amp this round, they would make great juniors to hire in
the future, or for other Ruby companies.

The people who come from coding academies, universities and who are self-
taught are the future brilliant developers of this community and we should
hire and start training them _today_.

### The Talent Code

There's a great book I encourage you all to read: it's called _The Talent
Code_. As the subtitle says "Greatness isn't born. It's grown." It's about 300
pages long. The book covers how skills of all varieties are grown in sports,
music and plenty of other areas. All the industries that are covered in the
book have active mentorship and apprenticeship programs. Yet, this is not
deeply cared about in the programming community for reasons mentioned earlier:
we're still quite a young community; we aren't mature enough to think long-
and-hard about mentorship and the sustainability of talent in this community
within our companies. We have events like the Rails InstallFests, and Rails
Girls, but we need more mentoring and junior opportunities within our
companies. These opportunities will bridge the gap between these events and
doing Rails- as-a-job. We need to focus more on growing talent within our
companies and community.

I'll let you in on the secret that's in the Talent Code: for anyone to get
better at anything, they need to practice the hell out of it, have a passion
for it _and_ they need to have a good mentor who is encouraging and can
provide sound advice. Okay, now you don't have to read 300 pages to learn
that. Scratch that book off your list.

How do we expect to have more seniors to hire if we're not hiring those non-
senior people and letting them improve their skills by practicing on real
world applications? They do not simply pop into existence. This isn't the
Matrix: we can't just plug in, and a few seconds later we just _know_ Rails.
They have to be taught. We have to grow talent if we want talent.

So many people are already talking about how good it would be to hire and mentor
juniors. Let's start doing it. Let's start having more of these conversations
to the management in our companies.

When you start interviewing them, you'll be pleasantly surprised at who you
find. I certainly was.

## Mentorship

OK, so you know now where to get juniors from, but what do you do once you
have them? They're going to need a lot of love and attention; you can't just
put them in the corner and expect them to thrive. Think more of them like a
puppy than a cactus: the puppy needs love and attention and some training, but
the cactus needs only sunshine and some water. The cactus is indifferent to
your love or your attention. Junior developers don't grow into senior
developers with just sunshine and water. And they don't do it just by
practicing, either. They need mentorship!

I used to help run the Melbourne Ruby Hack Night and it's a judgement-free
environment where anyone and everyone can bring along a Ruby project and work
on it. Some people are even there for the first time learning about Ruby
itself, which is so great to see. These Hack Nights work because these new
developers feel safe and welcome and that no question is too "dumb" to ask.

You could start these events in your cities. They're great for introducing new
developers to Ruby. Just like the Rails InstallFests and Rails Girls events,
they provide an avenue for new developers to enter this community.

You can also start mentoring at your company by fostering that Hack Night-
esque environment. It should be OK to put up your hand and ask a question
about _anything_. If the questioner is getting eyerolls, sighs, or other
passive aggressive signals from someone else, then that's not the kind of
environment where a junior is going to learn. That doesn't happen much in the
Ruby community because we're so good at building fostering environments, and
that whole MINASWAN ethos helps us do it. But very clearly outlining to
juniors that it's OK to ask _any_ question about _anything_ is a great place
to start. And repeat that as much as possible, too.

A great way to build that kind of hack-night-esque fostering environment is to
encourage pair programming. Pairing with juniors on small tasks initially is a
great way to build up their confidence. When I've been mentoring juniors, the
number one thing that I find that they're lacking isn't the skill, but the
confidence. They know the answer, but they aren't sure if it's the _right_
answer. They question if they're using the right syntax or even if they should
be writing the code that particular way. When a senior pairs with a junior,
they can encourage them to try out things and learn from the things that they
try. If the junior gets it wrong, the senior can ensure them that it's OK to
get things wrong and to guide them back on track. Pairing is the quickest way
to upskill a junior and I can highly, highly recommend it.

Remember: puppy, not cactus.

Pairing also helps reinforce your own knowledge. If you can't explain
something to someone clearly, then you do not understand it well enough
yourself. Pairing is helpful to the junior because they get knowledge out of
it, but it's also helpful to the senior: they learn how to share what's in
their brain with other people in a clearer fashion. As I said before, it also
teaches the most valuable skill of all: patience.

What should you pair with your junior on? Well, Lydia Guarino has some good
tweets about that.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">5) For junior devs, a good guideline for scope is something that can be completed in 2-3 days. You want to keep your feedback loop short.</p>&mdash; Lydia Guarino (@lydiaguarino) <a href="https://twitter.com/lydiaguarino/status/720090654575996928">April 13, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">5) Tasks with scope of more than 3 days are tasks that are not defined well enough.

I agree with both of these. Juniors thrive best when they're given quick wins.
You want that nice tight feedback loop to keep their confidence growing. Every
time they "win" at code, their confidence gets that little bit more boosted.
At Culture Amp, we started our juniors out on fixing bugs or working on little
features and then moved them up to trickier bugs and harder features from
there. Most bugs didn't take more than a day for the juniors to fix.

Once they've built up a bit of confidence, you can let them go solo on a task.
There isn't a set timeframe for when this happens; it's all about how
confident the junior is with their own abilities. Let them loose on something
small and make it clear that they can ask any questions about what they're
doing and that there is no wrong way of doing it.

Once they're done, get them to submit their work in a pull request and then --
this part's important -- sit together and review it.

Sitting together is important here because "why are you doing this?" written
in text has no emotion, compared to it spoken with body language. Juniors may
interpret a "why are you doing this?" comment as aggressive like "UGH! Why are
you doing this?".

Focussing on in-person communication helps establish a rapport between the
developers much better than text-based communication ever will.

If a junior has made a mistake in the pull request then you can discuss it
with them and correct the mistake. This way, that mistake will never make it
to a live production environment. Pull request reviews are good for that.

Code review also allows the senior to assess how well the junior has been
doing on the tasks they've been given. If they're doing well on a 2-day task,
then it's probably going to be OK to give them a 4-day task too. If not, then
some more mentoring may be required. And that's perfectly OK. Give them that
mentorship and direction, and try again.

### Feeling welcome

Ultimately, your mentorship should be about making the junior feel welcome and
safe within your team. In fact, this should be what's happening with
_everyone_ in your team. Remember Google's Project Aristotle that I mentioned
before wherein [they attempted to find how to build effective
teams](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-
team/). They interviewed hundreds of their own employees and they came up with
5 things:

![Google's 5 key dynamics for effective teams](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eQ_WsRq5-q-m_41eEI6GLEObqpxBYJd1pm96gIa-eRSn-QXlPjwO5K6O-DHU8sxny3ChnIQE0mjpnXaaW7QAhQ=s0)

The #1 item on this list is "Psychological safety": "Team members feel safe to
take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other." You probably recognise
that some of these things sound a lot like [Maslow's hierarchy of
needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), so that
Maslow guy was probably onto something.

The remainder of this list is not to be discounted. Dependability, Structure &
Clarity, Meaning and Impact are all vital to junior developers progressions.
When you hire a junior developer, keep these things in mind and ask yourself
regularly if you're following along with them. These things should underpin
everything you do with the junior.
