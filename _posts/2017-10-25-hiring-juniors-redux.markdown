## The "D" word

We have a diversity problem in the community, and that's been talked about
quite a lot when it comes to _tangible_ things like gender and race. A
diversity of skill -- an _intangible_ thing -- is also something we struggle
with. Our companies are very senior-heavy, and our thirst for hiring seniors is
unquenchable.

When I started out as a Rails developer, I was tinkering around with the
framework in my spare time, which I had a lot of because I was single and
working casually at Coles (the big-red-supermarket chain) in Australia and doing the
odd spot of PHP/Rails freelancing. I did the freelancing because the Coles work
was very casual and low-paying.

One day, I heard that there was a Ruby meetup happening in Adelaide and I
caught the train into town and _ran_ to the meetup because I was running very
late.

When I got there, people asked what I did and I told them about Coles, PHP and
Rails. They said "you don't need to work for Coles or write PHP anymore" and
three people gave me their business cards and said I should apply for a job. I
applied for a job at SeaLink -- a travel company that runs a ferry between the
mainland and Kangaroo Island -- and was accepted almost immediately.

At SeaLink, I got mentored by a team of "senior" Rails developers who had a
whole bunch of patience for my 19-year-old antics. And by "senior" Rails
developers I mean that they had two years worth of experience whereas I had
about 6 months. I am very thankful to them for the time that they spent
mentoring me, as I believe it helped provide a foundation for a career that
I've been doing for very close to 10 years.

In the early days, there was a lack of available talent and so companies had
to hire whoever they could find. That's why I found it easy to get a Rails job
back then. We have once again reached that point where there just
isn't any talent to hire. Not just in Australia, but around the world. Everyone
you'd want to hire already has jobs.

So how do we fix this issue where we can't find any talent? I think that the
fix is to hire and train up juniors to be the best and brightest talent that we
seek.

The issue with that, is not many people want to hire juniors in the first
place.

## Hiring juniors

Instead, these companies want to hire mid-to-senior developers and do not want
to have juniors who are learning alongside those mid-to-senior developers. This
is that unquenchable thirst that I was talking about earlier. We have to ship
things _fast_ and mentoring juniors means that we take time away from actually
shipping things. But what if I was to tell you that mentoring juniors meant
that you could ship things faster? Weird, I know. But hear me out.


Lawyers, mechanics and plenty of other professions have apprenticeships, so
why don't programmers? Why are we too busy, but lawyers aren't? Have you _seen_
what kind of hours lawyers put in? Fun fact: they're probably the only
profession that charges more than developers.

It's pretty strange that we, the people who get the computers to do the hard
thinking, can't find time to mentor a junior. Why are we too busy? What is the
big deal of training them up and leaving? Isn't leaving a common thing across
all levels in this industry? People leave companies all the time! So why the
aversion to hiring and training a junior, but not hiring and training a senior?

I think that other professions are not junior-adverse because those professions
have had turnover in their companies enough to learn the lesson about training
for the future. This Ruby community is still a young community where most
people have been doing it for less than 15 years. I think we are yet to see the
consequences of not preparing for our future.

This emphasis on shipping things faster and "delivering value" is short-term
enough to be frustrating. It's extremely myopic. The companies we're building
and the code we're writing will last longer than a month or two... usually. So
we need to think more long-term than shipping fast. For instance, Culture Amp
has existed for 6 years. Who's to say it won't exist for another 6?

What we really need to think about is: who will look after our code when we're
gone? How do we ensure the long-term survivability of our companies, and our
community as a whole? I'll answer those in a moment.

## Hiring seniors

Let's look at why companies want to hire mid-seniors in the first place. At
the companies I've worked at, we've wanted to hire a new mid-to-senior person
because our workload has gotten to the point where it's exceeding our
capacity. I figure that this is the same at other companies too. Tons of
companies are hiring at the moment for this very reason.

To address this problem, you hire a new developer or rather: you try to hire a
new developer. You want a mid-to-senior developer because they have the skills
to instantly dive straight into your application with little-to-no guidance
and they can start shipping code. That old expression: "they can hit the ground
running" This is because your code is so brillianly well-structured and
organised according to the Rails best practices and nobody will have to upskill
on any single part of the codebase at all because you all follow the Laws of
Sandi and Rules of Avdi to the letter. There is no legacy code with their
legacy decisions. HA.

However: the trick is finding someone who's available at the moment. In this
current climate, it's nearly impossible to hire a mid-to-senior Ruby developer
to come work for your company. What typically happens is that developers get
aggressively poached between companies. The salary and other bonuses are off
the charts.

Companies spend thousands of dollars on recruiters and lots of time posting to
job boards, for often very little good return. Companies spend this money to
hunt the elusive 10x Developer Rockstar Unicorns, but the Unicorns are no
longer out grazing in the sunny meadows, readily available for capture.
They're already working somewhere else and the conditions of where they work
are extremely competitive. You will have a hard time luring these unicorns
away.

This is because we, as a community, have drained the talent pool dry. We have
provided frankly very amazing working conditions for these developers, and so
as a result it's very hard to lure them away.

We're out of freely available Rockstar Unicorns and so it's time that we
started to grow our own. It's time that we started to hire and train our own
10x Developer Rockstar Unicorns.

Companies are addicted to hiring the top 5% or 10% of developers and ignoring
the rest. There is a lot of great talent in the remaining group of developers,
just waiting to be mentored. If they got that mentorship, we would be able to
bolster our community's best and brightest. What if the next person your
company mentored went on to become your next CTO? What if they went on to be
that "10x engineer" who can help out anyone on the team with anything? I
really believe companies are missing out on great talent by completely
ignoring it when it is non-obvious.

Too many companies are focussing on the short-term goals of shipping code,
rather than the long-term growth of their teams and the wider community. This
is to our detriment.

Companies are hiring the best-of-the-best -- the people with _proven_ great
track records working at other companies previously -- and getting them to
build what is essentially CRUD applications which do, at best, a fancy version
of string concatenation.

If we compare this to musicians: you're hiring the Beyonces, Kanyes and Ricks and
getting them to sing _Mary Had A Little Lamb_. Imma let you finish, but this
isn't a great tactic overall.

Google ran a project called Project Aristotle which looked into what makes
teams great. The initial thinking was that if you got a bunch of utterly
brilliant developers in a room together and put them to task to solve a Very
Hard Problem that they would knock it out of the park because of their sheer
brilliance. Their research proved this assumption wrong. What the research
showed was that a skill-diverse team _always_ performed better than a team of
brilliant minds. And not only that, but a gender-diverse team performed better
than one that was either all-male _or_ all-female. The best teams were the ones
that were gender _and_ skill-diverse. Google, as usual, has all the answers.

So when we hire all the brilliant developers we can get our hands on, we're
doing our companies a disservice. We're filling ourselves full-to-the-brim of
brilliant minds, and that, at least according to Google's research, isn't a
healthy thing to do. The healthy thing to do is to include people of a diverse
skill-level.

You may think that you need to hire these best-of-the-best badasses because
your application is a large unmaintable behemoth monolith and only the badasses
can understand it. That you need seniors to navigate the spaghetti that is your
legacy code. Maybe you use technologies that only _true_ geniuses can
understand.

That may indeed be the case. But in every monolith, there is a small bit of
functionality that a non-senior developer can work on improving along with
their skills, when that non-senior is paired with a senior developer. With even
a few months worth of training, these developers can be productive.

After all, senior devs don't grow on trees, you must give juniors a chance.
Don't take just my word for it. Here's a tweet from 4 years ago too:

https://mobile.twitter.com/buritica/status/492807632659689472

## Hiring juniors at Culture Amp

I know that juniors can be productive, because we're making it happen at Culture Amp.

In October 2016, we hired Lauren Hennessy, who is now a very productive member
of one of our teams. She has even started mentoring juniors herself, as a
mid-level developer. She was also someone who became President of Ruby
Australia based solely on the political campaign of "fuck it, why not?" -- and
then she did a marvellous job at that too.

In May 2017, we hired Ramya Ravindranath, a timid junior developer with such an
incredible thirst for self-improvement and knowledge. One day, I was trying to
explain `git checkout` to Ramya, and I was doing a terrible job at it. So I
linked her to the Git Book chapter on `checkout`. The next day, she just
casually mentions to me that she squashed and rebased a few commits. She jumped
from `git checkout` to `git rebase` in _one day_. More recently, she led
development efforts on a GraphQL application we were developing. She did the
research into GraphQL and worked with other members of her team to build it.

Then, in November, we hired another 5 juniors and spun up the first ever
Culture Amp Junior Engineering Program to provide structured training for them.

[[INSERT BLURB ABOUT OTHER JUNIORS HERE]]

## Contributing back

If your company is at least 5 developers and at least one of them wants to
mentor, you can hire a junior. You should try to hire one junior for every 5
non-junior members of your team. Your company will not go down in flames because
you hire a junior. Ours hasn't.

Your next question might be: "what do _we_ (as a company) get out of hiring a
junior?" I think that's backwards. The thinking should be "we have earned so
much from the community, and now it's time to give back". To ensure the
long-term viability of this great Ruby community we have, we need to train up
the next generation. If you invest in the long term health of the community, it
will pay even greater dividends. In the long run, you will have people who you
have trained up specifically to work on your application and who have the
knowledge and skills to teach other people. In the short term, you'll be
bolstering your team's productivity with fresh talent, ensuring the
sustainability of your company over the long term.

Yes, it's risky. Initially the cost of the employee is greater than what they
provide for the company. But with the right fostering, they can grow into the
best asset your company has ever had.

[Julia Claven](http://juliaclavien.tumblr.com/) has a great graph for this:

![Liability to asset](http://40.media.tumblr.com/19866bd84fa2fb1e0a5a3d85e516c015/tumblr_o3rr4h5L0Q1su3l4oo1_r1_1280.png)

When the junior is initially hired, their dollar value to the company is less
than the output they produce. That's OK, because you've got people at the other
end of this graph to balance that out: people producing more capital than
you're paying them. With good mentoring, these juniors can get the other end of the
graph where their value to the company outweighs their salary. 

There is an initial productivity hit -- that's true -- but that plateaus out
within 6 months if you do it right. We've found that to be true for Lauren and
Ramya.

At the end of training a junior for 6 months, rather than having one developer,
you have two developers.  Even if the junior is _half_ as productive as the
senior, then it's still a 1.5x growth in the productivity of your team.  If I
told you today that you could ship things 1.5x faster in 6 months time with
this one weird trick... you'd listen. Hiring a junior is that one weird trick.

Investing in a junior is investing in their future potential.

At Culture Amp, I would consider both Lauren and Ramya to be very productive
members of their respective teams, _and_ they're great people to work with to
boot. We would've missed out on these people if we didn't invest the time in
hiring and mentoring them and instead focussed on only hiring seniors who had
existing Rails app development experience.

One more thing: all of the juniors at Culture Amp have mentored our senior
developers on the most important programmer skill: patience. The seniors must
explain things to a junior, and that takes time. They might even have to
explain things more than once. Patiently explaining something to someone helps
seniors understand their own systems better and, in my extremely scientific
opinion, makes the seniors much better developers than if they only had to
explain things to other seniors.

Patience is a virtue that more developers should learn. The ironic thing about
me saying this is that I'm a naturally impatient person... who's getting more
patient because of the mentoring I'm doing. Huh, maybe it works.

## Finding Juniors

Ok, so that's a bit of history for how CA has hired juniors and have it work
out. Now you're definitely convinced you're hiring a junior and you're now
thinking of where you can find one.

Well, let's start with Code Academies. Not any particular one -- although
[Turing](https://www.turing.io) is my favourite. Code Academies solve _part_ of
this lack-of-mentoring problem.

Code academies get new programmers to pay thousands of dollars to learn the
tricks of the trade. Sometimes, these new programmers even get a "guarantee"
from the code academy that they'll get a job at the end of the course. The code
academies teach these newbies a range of programming skills. At the end of
this, the newbie programmers have enough skills to know the basics of things
like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby and can usually find their way around a
generic Rails app easily enough. These people are very "green" and then they're
thrust out into the community to work at companies.

Unfortunately, due to our senior hiring addiction, we're not hiring these
fresh faces. The code academies produce great talent, and we're not picking it
up. These people are left to struggle for months at a time in developing their
skills before they can even get a look in at a company. I've spoken to many
juniors in that position.

Not all of these graduates have the time to spend doing that skill
development, as they often have full time jobs or other responsibilities to
take care of. Thankfully, they get a lot of assistance from their code
academies after they've graduated. Well, at least the _good_ code academies do
that.

I would love to see companies breaking their addiction to seniors and more
actively hiring from these code academies, or even from universities. More
companies need to make mentorship / apprenticeship a part of what they do. The
students that graduate from code academies and universities are eager to learn
and are, in my experience, very highly motivated.

There are definitely juniors who have that same kind of eagerness-to-learn and
motivation who have never been to a code academy. These people have learned by
themselves and by being mentored by people in the community. I can think of
_at least_ 5, perhaps even 10, of these people who would make great hires in a
company's mentorship / apprenticeship program.

Asim Aslam (@chuhnk) had a good tweet about this too:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When hiring remember that someone once gave you an opportunity when you didn&#39;t have the experience. Hire smart raw talent and mentor them.</p>&mdash; Asim Aslam (@chuhnk) <a href="https://twitter.com/chuhnk/status/720756690493259777">April 14, 2016</a></blockquote>

There's a great book I encourage you all to read: it's called _The Talent
Code_. As the subtitle says "Greatness isn't born. It's grown." The book
covers how skills of all varieties are grown in sports, music and plenty of
other areas. All the industries that are covered in the book have active
mentorship and apprenticeship programs. Yet, this is not cared about in the
programming community for reasons mentioned earlier: we're still quite a young
community; we aren't mature enough to think long-and-hard about mentorship and
the sustainability of talent in this community.

I'll let you in on the secret that's in that book: for anyone to get better at
anything, they need to practice the hell out of it. How do we expect to have
more seniors to hire if we're not hiring those non-senior people and letting
them improve their skills by practicing on real world applications?

So many people are talking about how good it would be to hire and mentor
juniors. Let's start doing it. You should start looking at hiring juniors from
these code academies and universities. You'll be surprised at who you find.
When we were hiring junior developers, we were definitely surprised at the
amount of brilliant talent out there.

## Mentorship

OK, so you know now where to get juniors from, but what do you do once you have
them? They're going to need a lot of love and attention; you can't just put
them in the corner and expect them to thrive. Think more of them like a puppy
than a cactus: the puppy needs love and attention and some training, but the
cactus needs only sunshine. The cactus is indifferent to your love or your
attention. Junior developers don't grow into senior developers with just
sunshine. They need mentorship!

I used to help run the Melbourne Ruby Hack Night and it's a judgement-free
environment where anyone and everyone can bring along a Ruby project and work
on it. Some people are even there for the first time learning about Ruby
itself, which is so great to see. These Hack Nights work because these new
developers feel safe and welcome and that no question is too "dumb" to ask.

You can start mentoring at your company by fostering that Hack Night-esque
environment. It should be OK to put up your hand and ask a question about
_anything_. If the questioner is getting eyerolls, sighs, or other passive
aggressive signals from someone else, then that's not the kind of environment
where a junior is going to learn. That doesn't happen much in the Ruby
community because we're so good at building fostering environments, and that
whole MINASWAN ethos helps us do it.

A great way to build that kind of hack-night-esque fostering environment is to
encourage pair programming. Pairing with juniors on small tasks initially is a
great way to build up their confidence. When I've been mentoring juniors, the
number one thing that I find that they're lacking isn't the skill, but the
confidence.  They know the answer, but they aren't sure if it's the _right_
answer. They question if they're using the right syntax or even if they should
be writing the code that particular way. When a senior pairs with a junior,
they can encourage them to try out things and learn from the things that they
try. If the junior gets it wrong, the senior can ensure them that it's OK to
get things wrong and to guide them back on track. Pairing is the quickest way
to upskill a junior and I can highly, highly recommend it.

Remember: puppy, not cactus.

I paired daily with some developers a few years ago, with myself as the senior
developer and those developers as juniors to be mentored, and in a few
months time they were confident Rails developers who could find their way
easily around that Rails application. I've done the same at other companies too
and each time I've seen great professional growth in the juniors that I've
mentored. One of the best feelings in the world is when a junior says
"Ahhh, I understand!".

Pairing also helps reinforce your own knowledge. If you can't explain
something to someone clearly, then you do not understand it well enough
yourself. Pairing is helpful to the junior because they get knowledge out of
it, but it's also helpful to the senior: they learn how to share what's in
their brain with other people in a clearer fashion.

What should you pair with your junior on? Well, Lydia Guarino has some good
tweets about that.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">5) For junior devs, a good guideline for scope is something that can be completed in 2-3 days. You want to keep your feedback loop short.</p>&mdash; Lydia Guarino (@lydiaguarino) <a href="https://twitter.com/lydiaguarino/status/720090654575996928">April 13, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">5) Tasks with scope of more than 3 days are tasks that are not defined well enough. Break them down further.</p>&mdash; Lydia Guarino (@lydiaguarino) <a href="https://twitter.com/lydiaguarino/status/720090891231166464">April 13, 2016</a></blockquote>

I agree with both of these. Juniors thrive best when they're given quick wins.
You want that nice tight feedback loop to keep their confidence growing. Every
time they "win" at code, their confidence gets that little bit more boosted.

Once they've built up a bit of confidence, you can let them go solo on a task.
There isn't a set timeframe for when this happens; it's all about how
confident the junior is with their own abilities.

Let them loose on something small and make it clear that they can ask any
questions about what they're doing and that there is no wrong way of doing it.
Once they're done, get them to submit their work in a pull request -- you
might have to teach them what one is first -- and then sit together and review
it.

Sitting together is important here because "why are you doing this?" written
in text has no emotion, compared to it spoken with body language. Juniors may
interpret a "why are you doing this?" comment as aggressive like "UGH! Why are
you doing this?".

Focussing on in-person communication helps establish a rapport between the
developers much better than text-based communication ever will.

If a junior has made a mistake in the pull request then you can discuss it
with them and correct the mistake. This way, that mistake will never make it
to a live production environment. Pull request reviews are good for that.

Code review also allows the senior to assess how well the junior
has been doing on the tasks they've been given. If they're doing well on a
2-day task, then it's probably going to be OK to give them a 4-day task too.
If not, then some more mentoring may be required. And that's perfectly OK.

Ultimately, your mentorship should be about making the junior feel welcome and
safe within your team. In fact, this should be what's happening with
_everyone_ in your team. Remember Google's Project Aristotle that I mentioned
before wherein [they attempted to find how to build effective teams](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/). They interviewed hundreds of their own employees and they came up with 5 things:

![Google's 5 key dynamics for effective teams](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eQ_WsRq5-q-m_41eEI6GLEObqpxBYJd1pm96gIa-eRSn-QXlPjwO5K6O-DHU8sxny3ChnIQE0mjpnXaaW7QAhQ=s0)

The #1 item on this list is "Psychological safety": "Team members feel safe to
take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other." You probably recognise
that some of these things sound a lot like [Maslow's hierarchy of
needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), so that
Maslow guy was probably onto something.

The remainder of this list is not to be discounted. Dependability, Structure &
Clarity, Meaning and Impact are all vital to junior developers progressions.
When you hire a junior developer, keep these things in mind and ask yourself
regularly if you're following along with them. These things should underpin
everything you do with the junior

## The Elsewhere

There are plenty of juniors at the Melbourne Ruby Meetup. I know because I
talk to a lot of them. If a junior from this meetup was to tell you that they
were actively looking for a job right now, would you hire them? Probably not.
There seems to be quite an aversion to hiring juniors, and the main aversion
is that juniors take up valuable shipping time with mentoring time instead.

## The Main Concerns

When I talk to people about hiring juniors, there's two main problems that they raise:

* What if we train them up and they leave?
* We're too busy to bring on a junior at the moment

You might be thinking "but what if they leave"? That's a risk you take with
any hire of any skill level. If people are leaving your company, you should be
reflecting on why they're leaving in the first place. Was it really them, or
was it your company? Does your company have a culture that someone would want
to leave? Is your company focussed on building a culture that people want to
stay in? Is your company actively developing its people? Or are they only
interested in shipping code?
