title: Twist V2 - Live Coding
---

This year, I've been continuing on my work on [Twist](https://github.com/radar/twist-v2). As the README says:

> This is a rewrite of my [Rails-based book review app](http://github.com/radar/twist) in [rom-rb](https://rom-rb.org/), [dry-rb](https://dry-rb.org/), (some parts of) [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/), [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and whatever other Cool Hipster Techâ„¢ I can get my grubby hands on.

This application is a hybrid application, consisting of two distinct parts: a Ruby backend, and a TypeScript frontend. They communicate over GraphQL.

To demonstrate what working on this application is like, I'm doing some live coding sessions on it, every Wednesday morning.
