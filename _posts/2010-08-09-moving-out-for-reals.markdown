I promise I'll get back to the technical side of things soon. If you're reading this in desperation for more technical goodness I hear there may be <a href="http://manning.com/katz">a book that will sate your appetite</a>.

I've been thinking for the past couple of days of all the different possible combinations of what could happen. It effectively boils down to three options:

<ol>
  <li>Marcelo and Larissa get the place they applied for and we all move out together. Rent will be cheap but there are 3 other people I'd be sharing a house with: Marcelo, Larissa and Adrianna (the reason I'm moving out in the first place). They like parties, I don't.</li>
  <li>Marcelo and Larissa <strong>don't</strong> get the place they applied for, and then we're stuck in the sticky situation of me calling back my rental buddies saying things like "You know how I said I didn't need that place? I actually do need it." then them saying something like "It's been taken" and me pulling a GIGANTIC SADFACE.</li>
  <li>I move out to Narwee with one of the rental buddies I found on easyroommate.com.au, Tim.</li>
</ol>
The third option to me sounds like the best and most sensible right now. In hindsight, I don't know why this solution wasn't obvious from the beginning. If I move out of this place and Marcelo and Larissa don't get the place they applied for then it frees up the room for Adrianna to move into. I get to move to a new neighbourhood with a person with similar interests and perhaps meet some new people. I also free Tim of a roommate who's a bit of a "daddy's girl". A definite win-win-win.

I'll be out of here in probably two weeks, catching the train into work which is awesome since being on the train will give me more time to do writing / other things. 

Exciting times!
