 <font size="7">SCAFFOLD HAS BEEN DEPRECATED AS OF RAILS 2.0.</font>

There has seemingly been an infinite number of posts to the ruby on rails talk mailing list going "OMG SCAFFOLD IS NOT WORKING!!11!11PLZHALPNOW!1". I want all the newbies out there to understand that the <strong>Agile Web Development</strong> book is useless! (well, that part). STOP POSTING THAT SCAFFOLDING IS NOT WORKING. It is very irritating.

If you took the time out of your obviously extremely busy schedules and <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=rails+2.0+scaffold&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=">actually googled "Rails 2.0 scaffold"</a> you will see that the wonderful Google hamsters have scoured the internet and found people with such hastiness as yourselves! GOOGLE BEFORE ASKING. It saves a crap load of effort on both sides and stops me writing nasty posts like this.
