We (me, Paul, Thomo, Kellow, Steve and Cam) had another RadarLAN on the weekend and it was so much fun killing you all in CoD4 by calling in airstrikes and helicopters and accusing (rightfully!) Thomo of hacking in Trackmania that I've decided to try and hold one every 4 weeks. This means the next one would've been on the 21st June, but I'll be camping it up in Sydney then, so instead it will be on the 14th June.

Consider this your three weeks notice! No excuses that you didn't get the notification, because you should've read my blog, like all the good other people!
