I spent the weekend learning (read: having an affair with) Merb. I'm porting <a href='http://github.com/radar/rboard'>rboard</a> to <a href='http://github.com/radar/mboard'>mboard</a> whenever I feel like doing some merb. This is in the interest of seeing how much merb actually kicks Rails' ass and a learning experience for me. 

Also, Merb's source code is very, very pretty.
