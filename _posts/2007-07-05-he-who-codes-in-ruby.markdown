Tonight I was wondering what to have for dinner. I couldn't decide if I should go out and get takeaway or go out and get some ingredients for food and cook it, so I made this:

[code]options = ["Hungry Jacks","McDonalds","Subway","Cook it yourself, you lazy bogan!","Something from Fish & Chip Shop"]
puts options[rand(options.size)]
[/code]
