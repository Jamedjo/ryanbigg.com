title: Rails 5 in Action
---

I have been asked a few times since Rails 5 was released when Rails 5 in Action (an update to [Rails 4 in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action)) will be published. The short answer is that it won't be.

After Rails 4 in Action, I cut ties with Manning due to problems I've outlined in many previous posts. Most recently ["My self-publishing success story"](http://ryanbigg.com/2015/08/my-self-publishing-success-story). It just isn't worth any more energy/time to continue to work with that particular publisher. Since they are the ones that own the rights to the Rails * in Action series and the IP of the book, working on an update to Rails 4 in Action would mean working with the publisher, and that's not something that I would choose to do again.

Couple this with a 3-year "no-compete" clause that means I won't be able to publish any book-length Rails beginner content. So even a competing book to Rails 4 in Action is out of the question (at least for the next two and a bit years).

So Rails 5 in Action is _never_ coming out. [Rails 4 in Action's code](https://github.com/rubysherpas/r4ia_examples/) will still work with Rails 5 (mostly) and it's a valuable demonstration of how to build a decently sized Rails application.
