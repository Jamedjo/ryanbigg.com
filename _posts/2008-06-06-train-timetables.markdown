Been doing a little study on the trains, coded up a little rails application and out of curiosity I'm recording the stations, what time a train <strong>should</strong> get to a station and what time it does. Pretty simple really.

And <a href="http://pastie.org/210030">here's the results so far.</a>

If there's anybody else out there that journeys on the trains, I'd be interested if you could collect data for me for whatever line you're travelling on. You don't have to have a laptop, all I need is the stations and the time it stopped at them and what train you're on.
