title: "Screencast: wrong argument type"
---

I am really surprised at how well-received my <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2011/10/screencast-pilot/'>Conway's
Game of Life</a> screencast was. Seems that everyone who watched it liked it, which is always a nice thing :)

This week's screencast is a slightly more advanced topic: debugging a `wrong argument type Module (expected
class)` error which was happening inside of the `spree_paypal_express` Spree extension.

It's 28 minutes of debugging goodness and <a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/ryanbigg_screencasts/002-wrong-argument-type.mov'>you can view it here</a>.

The next screencasts I will do are examples of how to do nested attributes within Rails, covering
`belongs_to`, `has_many` and `has_many :through` associations, along with demystifying how nested attributes works
within Rails.
