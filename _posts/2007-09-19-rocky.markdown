There's this lady who works in the accounts department at SeaLink and they call her Rocky. She got that nickname for apparently coming into work with a broken neck. On Sunday night her mum suddenly passed away and she took the week off work to grieve. The funeral is today.

And then [url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,22448973-2682,00.html]this happened last night[/url]. Rocky's son was killed in a car rollover last night when he was only 17. I can't imagine her emotional state right now, after losing her mother so quickly and then her son.
