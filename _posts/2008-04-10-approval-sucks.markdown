title: Approval Sucks!

I removed comment approval on the site, so now when you post a comment it will show up immediately, rather than having to wait for approval. Yeah, it may be abused, but it's really easy to switch it back.

On a completely unrelated topic (due to the fact I'd have to go to posts and click the "Write Post" button again), another telemarketer called today and I gave her that old "<a href="http://frozenplague.net/2008/03/25/telemarketers-2">I'm a government agency</a>, don't call this number". Hook line and sinker. "Oh, very sorry sir. You will never be contacted again by this campaign." "I would prefer never again." I replied shortly before she wished me well and hung up. 100% success rate.
