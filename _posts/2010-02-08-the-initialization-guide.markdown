title: The Initialization Guide
wordpress_url: http://ryanbigg.com/?p=811
---
For a couple of weeks now I've been writing <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/guides/initialization.html">a guide on how the initialization process in Rails 3 works</a>. As of writing, the guide and its accompanying "notes" totals over 10,000 words. I admit that this is currently nowhere near completion, but I am working on it and I need <strong>your help</strong>. I need people to go over it for me and point out anything that they don't quite understand or I have stated incorrectly and <a href="http://github.com/radar/how-rails-works/issues">file an issue on the repository for it.</a> Originally I was going to accept pull requests but they aren't "public knowledge" and I don't want two or more people submitting pull requests to fix the same chunk of code. With issues, people can see that "oh, there's already a typo here." and move on to finding more errors and punching more holes through it.

So yeah, if you guys could <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/guides/initialization.html">read my guide</a> and  <a href="http://github.com/radar/how-rails-works/issues">file any issues you find with it</a>, that'd be swell!
