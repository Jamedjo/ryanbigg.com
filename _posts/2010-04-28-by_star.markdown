It's plugin / gem pimping time!

I started writing <a href='http://github.com/radar/by_star'>by\_star</a> back in November 2008 when Thomas Sinclair asked me if I could write a method that could find records for a given month. I was in my gem creating phase then so I created a gem called by\_month and Thomas paid me for it (the sucker!).

Later on, I realised that by\_month wasn't good enough so I added a couple more finders to it. Then I added some more. Now you can find by all of these things:

* A given year
* A given month
* A given fortnight
* A given week
* A given weekend
* A given day
* The current weekend
* The current work week
* The Past
* The Future
* Between certain times
* As of a certain time
* Up to a certain time
* Before a specific record
* After a specific record

So if you're ever doing anything in your application where you need to find by dates / times, why are you not using <a href='http://github.com/radar/by_star'>by\_star</a>? Here's a good reason you should be using by\_star:

<strong>Before by\_star</strong>
    
     Post.all(:conditions => ["created_at >= ? AND created_at <= ?", "01/01/#{Time.now.year}".to_time, "31/01/#{Time.now.year}"])

<strong>After by\_star</strong>

    Post.by_month(1)

This is only a <strong>taste</strong> of the shiny things in by\_star! Use it!
