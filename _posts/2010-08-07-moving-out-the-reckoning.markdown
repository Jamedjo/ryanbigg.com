title: "Moving Out: The Reckoning"

 I wrote a post last weekend saying that my housemates were asking me to move out so that their cousin could move in. Since then, I've looked at about 6 different places throughout the week like:

* A place in Surry Hills on the 7th floor of an apartment building
* Tiny little room in a terrace in Surry Hills
* A largeish room in Five Dock, but way way waaay away from public transport
* A medium-sized room in Narwee, with a really awesome guy
* A tiny room in Summer Hill

I got all these contacts through the sites <a href='http://gumtree.com.au'>Gumtree.com.au</a> and <a href='http://easyroommate.com.au'>Easyroommate.com.au</a>, and it's a really easy process. Just getting to the places take a while.

I met quite the broad spectrum of people and was keen on moving to Narwee since that was the most affordable and the guy was a linux sysadmin (this is the part where you berate me for not stepping outside my comfort zone, and where I counter-claim that comfort zones exist for reasons you *just wouldn't understand*).

Then as I was going between places today my current housemates text me with a whole slew of pictures showing an awesome 3 bedroom house that we can all move into basically around the corner from where we're at right now. First bedroom's for them, second for their cousin and third for me, so it all works out well. And with 3 different "groups" paying the rent, it's going to be way cheaper than any of the other places. So I think I'll be sticking with these guys since they're only thinking of having it for the short term (until December) anyway. It's great that I get to stay with Marcelo and Larissa, I really enjoy their company.

Of course by me now staying with them, I now have to phone up the people who I've "interviewed" with over this past week and tell them all "thanks but no thanks". That's a "tomorrow job", for certain. Totally buggered tonight.

It'd be nice having a little bit of certainty for my future, but I should know by this stage (after moving interstate twice in two years) that certainty is only a word, and would never be more than that. Nothing is certain, everything changes, and you just have to deal with it. This is just another one of those things. Next year I may even be in another country. I'm cool with that. Parents may not be, however.

So I'm here until December at least, and then after that I guess I'll go all mercenary and sell my soul / body to the highest bidder / most awesome looking place. Who knows? Nothing is certain. Everything changes.
