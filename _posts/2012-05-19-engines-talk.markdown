title: Engines talk
---

I gave a presentation at SpreeConf and Ruby on Ales about engines.

I recorded it again at home last week and You can [watch/download the video here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ryanbigg_screencasts/004-engines_talk.mov). It's a
little over 30 minutes long, but I think it teaches you valuable lessons about engines in Rails.
