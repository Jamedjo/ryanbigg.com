Today, Google released possibly the most awesome invention since sliced bread, women and pants: <a href="http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,27574,24733309-15306,00.html">Google Transit.</a> This is something I would've loved to had when I was in school since Adelaide Metro's website was so... ugh. This'll also be useful when my car breaks down or comes across another pedestrian. Google has outdone themselves again and I think I'm in love with them (but not in the crazed stalker kind of way).

It would also appear that they need to <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/3076745122/'>work out some kinks</a>.
