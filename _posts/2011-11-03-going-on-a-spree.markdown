title: Going on a Spree
---

When I was in America, I had the pleasure of talking to a lot of Americans. Americans are fun. As soon as they
hear the Australian accent they say something along the lines of "Oh, you're from Australia?! I *love*
Australia!".

While I was there, I was thinking that there's just *so much* work out in the world. So many people doing super
interesting things. I started to think that perhaps I should take a break from "shotgun consulting" again, but
only if I could find one thing that I was super passionate about.

I was courted by so many different companies when I was at GoGaRuco and Strangeloop and while I was in Chicago.
Stuff ranging from a joking "Screw those guys, come work for us!" to more serious "We'll do whatever it takes you
get you on board". You know what's a really good feeling? Being wanted. It's so *amazing*. So thanks to those
companies and their employees for their offers.

While I was in Chicago, I got into some serious-type discussions with two companies. One of them was Groupon,
where I sat for about a week doing work remotely for RubyX. I think they have an amazing team at Groupon
(including people like Bo Jeanes, who I am very good friends with), but it's
a bit too large for what I wanted to do.

On the very same day that these serious-type discussions happened with Groupon, the same kind of discussions
started with a slightly smaller company called <a href='http://spreecommerce.org'>Spree Commerce</a>. Sean and I started
talking about a Community Manager position that he wanted to fill, a position that involves full-time open source
work and talking with members of the community seeing to their needs. Spree has <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/10/spree-raises-1-5-million-from-true-ventures-aol-for-open-source-ecommerce-platform/'>$1.1 million</a> dollars of funding, which will go into some pretty exciting projects.

That is precisely the thing I am passionate about: making a product and the community around it *better*. Spree has a great platform and it will only get better with time.

For instance, we have <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/spree-user/msg/af44fbdb7e401b8e'>just undertaken work to move all of Spree's functionality into a namespace</a>. This will be merged back into the`master` branch next week. This means that if you want to have a `Product` model in your application and still want to use Spree's then that's entirely possible. I go into more information in <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/spree-user/msg/af44fbdb7e401b8e'>this lengthy post on the Google Group</a> about what the namespacing means.

I'm excited to start officially at Spree next week and I wish RubyX all the best for their future endeavours. If
you want a crack team people to build your Rails application, RubyX is that team.
