Yesterday I went into the bathroom and saw that the light coming in through the window was very bright and illuminated my eye very well. I took out my tripod and my camera and used the mirror so I could see the reflection of the screen in it and took about 30 photos before I got one I liked.  It looked awesome! I needed something as a dual desktop display and I thought the eye would make a wonderful background. I put it into photoshop and made <a href="http://frozenplague.net/images/eyes.jpg">this 2560x1024 background image.</a>

To use it put it in C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper, right click on the desktop and go to properties, select the desktop tab, click the "eyes" image and change the position to tile.
