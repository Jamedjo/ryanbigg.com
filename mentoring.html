<h2>1-on-1 Mentoring for Developers</h2>

<em>Available from January 2020</em>

<p class='large'>
  <strong>Do you want to get to the next level as a developer? Accelerate your career by working with me.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  I provide affordable pairing sessions for developers of all skill-levels.
</p>

<p>
  Do you need help squashing that super annoying bug? What about getting that important feature over the line? Maybe a React component just won't co-operate and the JavaScript involved makes your head spin. Or you need help navigating through a gnarly Rails application. I can help with all of these things.
</p>

<p>
  Maybe you're starting out and you're looking for a teacher to help you learn the basics. I can help with that too!
