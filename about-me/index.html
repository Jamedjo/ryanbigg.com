    <h3>
      My name's Ryan Bigg and I enjoy writing more than most "normal" people would deem normal. On a good day, I can write about 10,000 words. On a bad day, probably 1,500.     I am currently gainfully employed at <a href='http://rubyx.com'>RubyX</a> doing awesome things with Ruby code. We're amazing at what we do. On the side, I'm writing a book called <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a> which you should buy. 
    </h3>

      <strong>If you're a recruiter contacting me for a job, please note the previous paragraph. If you still think about contact me, include the phrase "Bravo Foxtrot Uniform" so that I can verify you've done your research.</strong> If you do not do your research then why should I bother even replying to your email? It's a two-way street, bucko.

      Alright, that's the boring formalities out of the way.
    </p>

    <p>I've been doing Ruby and Rails for about the past 4 years and I consider myself expert at it. I don't profess to know everything, I just know a lot and I've got a fair bit of experience at developing Rails applications.</p>

    <p>I write mostly about Ruby and Ruby on Rails, <a href="http://manning.com/katz">I'm even writing a book on it!</a>. Other times I write about the community in general in such posts as <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/want-it-give/">Want it? Give</a>, <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/you-suck/">You suck.</a> and <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/advanced-rails-documentation/">Advanced Rails Documentation</a>. Whilst the tone of some of the posts on this blog may seem angry, I am just extremely passionate about the community and don't want it to die. If it dies, then I'm basically out of a job. Do not want.</p>

    <p>I've done work on the official Rails guides, by writing such interesting guides as the first copy of the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html">Active Record Querying Guide</a> as well as beginning work on <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html">Rails Internals: The Rails 3 Initialization Process</a> and eventually I'll get around to completing it.</p>

    <p>I'm also trying to float the idea of <a href="https://github.com/radar/guides">Ruby Ecosystem Guides</a>, and perhaps one day receiving donations to work on them for a living. Currently there's only the Gem Development Guide (using Bundler, Thor, RSpec and Cucumber), but later on I plan on having a guide on how to develop an engine using Rails 3.1.</p>

    <p>Besides writing Gigantic Walls of Text, I also write code. Some of my favourite projects to work on are <a href="http://github.com/radar/rboard">rboard</a> (a forum system built in Rails), <a href="http://github.com/radar/lookup">lookup</a> (a gem that allows you to look up Ruby and Rails methods in the API from your terminal and <a href="http://github.com/radar/summer">summer</a>, a tiny IRC bot framework (with inspiration from <a href="http://github.com/RISCFuture/autumn">autumn</a>.</p>

    <p>I also work as a Ruby on Rails consultant for <a href='http://rubyx.com'>RubyX</a> in Sydney. We're awesome. I do code reviews, training and application development there and am really enjoying it. I am not actively looking for any more jobs. I said this before, but it bears repeating.</p>
    
    <p>My last job was teaching a small team of PHP developers at <a href="http://getup.org.au">GetUp</a> Ruby on Rails and the best practices (such as BDD and Agile) associated with it. </p>

    <p>I'm really passionate about building a better community for Ruby and for Rails, and I've been known to lurk on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> and answer questions there, as well as previously on the #rubyonrails IRC channel. I attend the RoRoSyd meetups in Sydney, some ActionHacks in Brisbane when I'm about, and all the Australian Railscamps. If you need help with anything Ruby or Rails related, ask me and I can probably help you or get you contact with someone who can.</p>
