## Postcards

My 30th birthday is coming up soon and I thought you could all send me a
present: a postcard from where you live. I want to see where in the world
people who read my books are from, and have these postcards to show my
daughter. I'm also thinking of having a big world map with pins in it, showing
where these postcards have come from. That'd be really cool!

Please send your postcard with a little blurb of either:

1. About your city / country or;
2. How you know me

To this address:

```
Ryan Bigg
c/o Culture Amp
Level 10, 31 Queen Street
Melbourne VIC 3001
Australia
```

Thanks!
