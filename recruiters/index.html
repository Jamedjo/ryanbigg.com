    Hello! You probably have been sent this page because you're a recruiter.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href='https://au.linkedin.com/in/ryan-bigg-73379b9a'>My LinkedIn profile</a> says this:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    No recruiters, thanks.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/about-me'>My "About me" page</a> has this paragraph:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    If you want to contact me for a job, <em><strong>include the phrase "Bravo Foxtrot Uniform"</strong></em>. 
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    If you're a recruiter and you're reading this page: you have probably already
    failed my first two tests. You <em>didn't</em> include the magical phrase and you
    <em>didn't</em> follow my precise "no recruiters" instructions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have these two checks in place for a <em>very</em> good reason: I get contacted by
    a lot of people (recruiters and otherwise) about jobs, career opportunities,
    and related things. these two tests are the only way that I know that you've
    done your research on me and that you've figured out that I'm an <em>especially</em>
    good fit for the job, and not just another warm body that knows how to code. There are plenty of
    places that could hire me for my warm-bodyness, and a select few that would
    hire me for my skills and good fit into the company and their culture.
  </p>

  <p>
    To be frank, I view this kind of recruiting as the laziest form of recruiting there is. I <strong>strongly</strong> feel that recruiters would have more luck if they did their research on the companies and candidates and worked on building relationships. By doing no such work, recruiters are doing the community a great <em>disservice</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      If you've reached this page, you're treating me like a warm body.</strong> In my
  professional experience, these kinds of job placements don't pan out well for company or candidate, and
  so I'm actively trying to avoid them.
  </p>

    <strong>I will only consider job offers from people who have done their research.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks for respecting my wishes.
  </p>
