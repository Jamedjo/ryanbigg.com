Hello! You probably have been sent this page because you're a recruiter.

<a href='https://au.linkedin.com/in/ryan-bigg-73379b9a'>My LinkedIn profile</a> says this:

> No recruiters, thanks.

<a href='http://ryanbigg.com/about-me'>My "About me" page</a> has this paragraph:

> I am not actively looking for any more jobs. If you still really really really feel like contacting me about a job, **include the phrase "Bravo Foxtrot Uniform"**, just so I know you've done your research. If you do not include this phrase, I will assume you have not done your research. I get contacted quite often by recruiters, and this phrase is what I use to weed out those who have done their research and those who haven't.


If you're a recruiter and you're reading this page: you have probably already
failed my first two tests. You *didn't* include the magical phrase and you
*didn't* follow my precise "no recruiters" instructions.

I have these two checks in place for a _very_ good reason: I get contacted by
a lot of people (recruiters and otherwise) about jobs, career opportunities,
and related things. these two tests are the only way that I know that you've
done your research on me and that you've figured out that I'm an _especially_
good fit for the job, and not just another warm body. There are plenty of
places that could hire me for my warm-bodyness, and a select few that would
hire me for my skills and good fit into the company and their culture.

**If you've reached this page, you're treating me like a warm body.** In my
professional experience, these kinds of job placements don't pan out well, and
so I'm actively trying to avoid them.

**I will only consider job offers from people who have done their research.**

Thanks for respecting my wishes.
