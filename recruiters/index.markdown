Hello! You probably have been sent this page because you're a recruiter.

<a href='http://ryanbigg.com/about-me'>My "About me" page</a> has this paragraph:

> I am not actively looking for any more jobs. If you still really really really feel like contacting me about a job, **include the phrase "Bravo Foxtrot Uniform"**. 

Followed immediately by:

> No recruiters, thanks.

If you're a recruiter and you're reading this page: you have probably already failed my first two tests. You *didn't* include the magical phrase and you *didn't* follow my precise "no recruiters" instructions.

All hope is not lost, however. Here's how you can be better at your job and get people to respect you.

## How to be a better recruiter

There's this one weird tip that you can use to be a better recruiter.

It's a long-held secret, that only the best recruiters know about. If you're on this page, you don't know about it.

But I am willing to share it with you.

Are you ready?

Here it is:

### Actually care about the people who you're contacting.

This works wonders. The only recruiter to have successfully approached me for a job interview has shown that they _cared_ about me. That's all that you have to do. That is literally your job.

Can you do that for me? I would really appreciate it.

Thank you for your time.
