<h2>I am currently looking for work.</h2>

<p class="large">
  I'm finishing up at Culture Amp at the end of November 2019. I'll be looking
  for work to begin in 2020.
</p>

<p>
  At Culture Amp, I have been running a Junior Engineering Program (JEP) for 2
  years, training two groups of junior developers -- about 20 people in total. I
  enjoyed this job so much that I would really love the opportunity to do
  something like that again at another company. You can read my
  <a href="/2018/08/culture-amp-junior-engineering-program-retrospective">
    JEP #1: Retrospective
  </a>
  and <a href="/2019/03/jep-2-first-8-weeks">JEP #2: The First 8 Weeks</a> to
  get a feel for the kind of work I accomplished during the running of the JEP.
</p>

<p>
  Before the JEP, I worked for over a decade in plenty of different spaces:
  developer relations, ecommerce and internet-of-things. I've been working with
  teams large and small, writing languages such as Elixir, Ruby, TypeScript,
  React, Ruby and Go.
</p>

<p>
  Alongside my regular full time work, I have have also written
  <a href="/books">almost 10 books on Ruby and Elixir</a> over my career too.
</p>

<h3>My Ideal Role</h3>

<p>
  I loved mentoring junior developers at Culture Amp. What mattered to me here
  is that I felt like I was making a difference in developers' lives, and I was
  consistently supported in whatever I wanted to accomplish.
</p>

<p>
  I have an incredible passion for growing new developers, and this is what I
  would love to keep doing over the long-term. As such, I am currently not
  interested in any "senior developer" role, in any language. I would really
  rather be teaching and growing developers at the moment.
</p>

<p>
  (Or if someone was to pay me to mentor juniors <em>and</em> write books
  full-time then I'd be up for that too!)
