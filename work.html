<h2>Working with me</h2>

<p class="large">
  I'll be straight with you: I am not currently looking for work. <em>Especially</em> not looking for work as a developer.
</p>

<p>
  This means that you really, really should not contact me regarding any "new exciting opportunities" or the like.
</p>

<p>
  I am not willing to relocate away from Melbourne, Australia at this time. Any job offer for another city or country would <em>definitely</em> be wasting your time.
</p>

<h3>Still want to contact me about a job? Read on!</h3>

<p>
   If you're contacting me about a job: <em><strong>please include the phrase "Bravo Foxtrot Uniform"</strong></em>, just so I know that you've done your research. It at least lets me know you reached this page. I explain my reasoning for this <a href='/recruiters.html'>over here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I would also appreciate it if you took the time to read my <a href='/history.html'>work history</a> to get to know the kinds of companies I've chosen to work at before.
</p>

<p>The best way to contact me is <a href='mailto:me@ryanbigg.com'>via email</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/ryanbigg'>Twitter (@ryanbigg)</a>. However, before you contact me please read the rest of this page.

<h3>My Ideal Role</h3>

<p>
  My ideal role is the one I'm currently in: mentoring junior developers at a large-ish company. I built this role myself, so I'm very keen on keeping it.
</p>

<p>
  I have an incredible passion for growing new developers, and this is what I would love to keep doing over the long-term. As such, I am currently not interested in any "senior developer" role at a company. I would really rather be teaching people at the moment.
</p>

<p>
  Or if someone was to pay me to mentor juniors <em>and</em> write books full-time then I'd be up for that too.
