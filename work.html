<h2>Working with me</h2>

<p class="large">
   If you're contacting me about a job: <em><strong>please include the phrase "Bravo Foxtrot Uniform"</strong></em>, just so I know that you've done your research. It at least lets me know you reached this page. I explain my reasoning for this <a href='/recruiters.html'>over here</a>.
</p>

<p class="large">The best way to contact me is <a href='mailto:me@ryanbigg.com'>via email</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/ryanbigg'>Twitter (@ryanbigg)</a>. However, before you contact me please read the rest of this page.

<p class="large">
  <strong>I am not currently looking for work. This means that you really, really should not contact me regarding any "new exciting opportunities" or the like.</strong> I'm running the Junior Engineering Program at <a href='https://cultureamp.com'>Culture Amp</a> from at least November 2017 until May 2018, so I'll be really busy during that time.
</p>

<p>
  My ideal role is the one I'm currently in: mentoring junior developers at a large-ish company. I have an incredible passion for growing new developers, and this is what I would love to keep doing over the long-term.
</p>

<p>
  Or if someone was to pay me a decent wage to write books full-time then I'd be up for that too.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently not interested in any "senior developer" role at a company. I would really rather to be responsible for training and development of new developers than doing development myself. I've done enough of that for now.
