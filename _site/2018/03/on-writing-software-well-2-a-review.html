            <small>15 Mar 2018</small><br>
            <p>A few people have asked for my opinions on DHH&#39;s recent video series. And others have bemoaned the lack of a critical take on the videos. So here&#39;s a critical take involving my opinions on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1jOWu7woKM">DHH&#39;s 2nd video</a>) in the series.</p>

<p>Why not start with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5i1gdwe1Ls">Video #1 in the series</a>? Because it was great! Code comments that explain why things are the way they are... those are incredibly useful to people new / unfamiliar with parts of a codebase. His points were well made and I find nothing worth commenting on. (Pun intended)</p>

<p>Video #2 though has the word &quot;callbacks&quot; in it and so I&#39;m intrigued to hear what DHH has to say about it.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s some &quot;real-time&quot; opinions that I wrote down while watching this video for a <em>third</em> time. If you like this sort of thing, let me know in the comments below.</p>

<h2>Initial reactions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ew callbacks. I&#39;ve been bitten enough times by these -- mainly cases where callbacks are happening when I do not expect them to. Things like where I might call <code>create</code> on a model in a unit test and that causes some <em>other</em> behaviour via callback that isn&#39;t relevant to the test. I&#39;d prefer to be explicit in these cases to save surprises.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve heard mention that these talks might include Rails concerns (modules being included to add behaviour to classes), so I&#39;d suggest you stop right here, get out your favourite drink of choice and take a drink whenever you see a concern used in the Rails app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1:35 - &quot;Side effects&quot;</h2>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Side effects .. has gotten also a bit of a bad reputation, especially in functional programming&quot; -- Yeah, because <em>random magical shit</em> happening when you call a method isn&#39;t easily predictable. Having the code be explicit about what it&#39;s doing makes it easier to understand it <em>now</em> and <em>later</em>. The later part is what I think DHH is missing here.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2:13 - Messages Controller</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>@bucket.record</code> takes <em>far</em> too many arguments. What is it doing with them all? And P.S. do you even newline your key / value pairs?</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="vi">@bucket</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">record</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">new_message</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="ss">parent: </span><span class="vi">@parent_recording</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="ss">status: </span><span class="n">status_param</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="ss">subscribers: </span><span class="n">find_subscribers</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="ss">category: </span><span class="n">find_category</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I think that this reads a little better -- and the Git diff would be neater if a new key was added and removed. It <em>feels</em> like <code>category</code> <em>might</em> one be of those things that was added recently and just chucked onto the end here.</p>

<p>TBH a little surprised here that he&#39;s using <code>@parent_recording</code> which is setup as a  <code>before_action</code>,  but <code>find_subscribers</code> and <code>find_category</code> aren&#39;t. They&#39;re called explicitly here. I&#39;d expect some sort of consistency... but maybe there&#39;s a reason for that? The methods are folded at the bottom of the controller so I can&#39;t get a good idea of what those are doing to really judge whether or not it&#39;s a good choice.</p>

<h2>4:15 - <code>Mention</code> model</h2>

<ul>
<li>This model is pretty neat. I cringe a little (PTSD, I guess) on the sight of the <code>after_create</code> and <code>after_commit</code> uses.</li>
<li>Interesting that the model doesn&#39;t inherit from <code>ApplicationModel</code>. Probably a legacy app thing.</li>
<li>Neat use of <code>casecmp</code> in <code>callsign_matches?</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>unless</code> in <code>after_commit :deliver</code> irks me a little, but maybe it&#39;s due to me preferring to keep all the logic inside of methods? I&#39;d write it like this:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">deliver</span>
 <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">unless</span> <span class="n">mentioner</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">mentioned</span>

<span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">.</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nf">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>5:55 - <code>Recording::Mentions</code> concern</h2>

<p><em>DRINK</em> -- there&#39;s a concern here. [bad joke about it being &quot;concerning&quot;]</p>

<h3>Callbacks</h3>

<ul>
<li>Okay, so this is using more callbacks. I feel like <code>remember_to_eavesdrop</code> could be something set &quot;further up&quot; in the chain, probably in the controller. The controller itself could check to see if these things have changed, and then from there choose to send out the mentions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Current Attributes</h3>

<p>The other thing is <code>Current</code> -- used in <code>eavesdrop_for_mentions</code> down the bottom of the code view here.</p>

<p>I already <a href="https://ryanbigg.com/2017/06/current-consider-harmful">wrote about CurrentAttributes at length</a>. Global variables magically being available <em>everywhere</em> in the application. Where is <code>Current.user</code> set? How can I be sure it&#39;s set to a value here?</p>

<h3>Abstracting out the logic for triggering the job</h3>

<p>This whole eavesdropping thing <em>feels</em> like it could be wrapped in some other logic (in a controller, perhaps). It&#39;s practically begging for it. Basecamp probably doesn&#39;t want to be persisting Messages to the database in its tests and having this job code run <em>every single time</em>, but that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s going to happen here. It&#39;d probably slow down the tests due to these side-effects.</p>

<p>It would be better abstracted out to a &quot;service object&quot; which creates the recording and then triggers this <code>EavesdroppingJob</code>. Bonus thing there is that you can pass <code>current_user</code> from the controller and hey look I just got rid of the <code>CurrentAttributes</code> global variable thing.</p>

<p>An idea of what that might look like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Mention</span>
  <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">EavesdropForMentions</span>
    <span class="kp">attr_reader</span> <span class="ss">:recording</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:params</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">user</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">recording</span><span class="p">:,</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="p">:,</span> <span class="ss">user: </span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="vi">@recording</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">recording</span>
      <span class="vi">@params</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">params</span>
      <span class="vi">@user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">user</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">run</span>
      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">unless</span> <span class="n">eavesdropping?</span>

      <span class="no">Mention</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">EavesdroppingJob</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">perform_later</span> <span class="n">recording</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">mentioner: </span><span class="n">user</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="kp">private</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">eavesdropping?</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">active_or_archived_recordable_changed?</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="n">draft_became_active?</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span>
      <span class="o">!</span><span class="no">Mention</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Eavesdropper</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">suppressed?</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span>
      <span class="n">recording</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">has_mentions?</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">active_or_archived_recordable_changed?</span>
      <span class="c1"># code here to check change using recordable + params</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">draft_became_active?</span>
      <span class="c1"># code here to check change using recordable + params</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I don&#39;t have the big Basecamp app to play with, so i don&#39;t know for certain if this code will or won&#39;t work. What I do know is that it neatly encapsulates <em>potentially</em> performing the <code>Mention::EavesdroppingJob</code> later and avoids the issue where saving a <code>Recording</code> in <em>any</em> context might queue up a job as a side-effect.  My approach here decouples those two things, allowing them to happen independently.</p>

<p>Essentially, it accomplishes the same thing in (probably) as many lines, but disconnecting it from the saving of the model is the big win in my mind.</p>

<h3>Callback suppression</h3>

<p>Yay more global state appearing out of the blue (<code>Mention::Eavesdropper.suppressed?</code>). What could possibly go wrong? How can I track down easily where this might be toggled in the codepath that leads to this method? This looks like it would make debugging hard.</p>

<p>DHH himself says (at ~11mins) he thinks that there might be situations where you don&#39;t want callbacks to happen. Okay, great. So make it so that it can be an optional part of your code (as above), rather than this spooky-action-at-a-distance <code>Mention::Eavesdropper.suppressed?</code>.</p>

<p>Re-organising the code to <em>optionally</em> trigger this eavesdropping behaviour would lead to a lower cognitive overhead for working with this code.</p>

<h3><code>has_mentions?</code></h3>

<p>Special mention (ha) of <code>has_mentions?</code> at the bottom of this module which does seem to at least abstract the behaviour of checking if something has mentions.</p>

<h2>13:23 - <code>Mention::EavesdroppingJob</code></h2>

<p>It feels a lot like <code>Current.set</code> here is a cheap way of passing account through to <code>mention::Eavesdropper</code> and its associated things. I am not sure why this is wrapped this way, given that the account would be accessible in the <code>Eavesdropper</code> class -- assuming it&#39;s setup like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Mention</span>
  <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Eavesdropper</span>
    <span class="kp">attr_reader</span> <span class="ss">:recording</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">recording</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="vi">@recording</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">recording</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">.</span><span class="p">.</span>
  <span class="nf">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But at least, this <code>Eavesdropper</code> class is abstracted away and isn&#39;t a concern. There feels to me like concerns are used as a bit of a &quot;golden hammer&quot; in this application.</p>

<h2>13:45 - run-through of all the parts</h2>

<p>DHH jumps straight from the controller to the <code>Recording::Mentions</code> concern here. (DRINK)</p>

<p>My initial thought here was: how is someone unfamiliar with this application supposed to know that the <code>Recording::Mentions</code> concern is where to look for this eavesdropping behaviour if they were to go about debugging it?</p>

<p>This is spooky-action-at-a-distance and it&#39;s the kind of code that I might&#39;ve written a few years ago and felt very smart <em>at the time</em>, but then months later when I&#39;ve gone back to visit it I&#39;ve asked myself: &quot;wtf was past-Ryan taking?&quot;</p>

<p>DHH says around the 14:10 mark that &quot;there&#39;s a fair amount of indirection here but it provides a very clear path of reading what&#39;s going on in the method&quot;. Out of anything else in this video, this is the #1 thing that I disagree with the <em>most</em>. The path is completely ambiguous to my &quot;untrained&quot; eye -- I am unfamiliar with this application.</p>

<p>It is &quot;clever code&quot; and that is dangerous because future-you will come back and look at the code in a few months time and wonder how it all fit together again.</p>

<h2>14:20 - <code>Mention::Eavesdropper</code></h2>

<p>And now we get to a class which actually has an idea of what the Single Responsibility Principle is.</p>

<p>(Interestingly, DHH can&#39;t navigate his own code at the ~14:30 mark)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already talked about CurrentAttributes before, so what I&#39;ll do here is just sigh longingly, wishing wistfully for the death of global state in any and all applications.</p>

<p>&quot;Globals is not something that you should just litter over your application&quot; -- MY MAN! This is what you&#39;re doing here. &quot;Passing around this stuff isn&#39;t helpful&quot;. Ok, here&#39;s the #2 thing I disagree with. When passing things around, you gain an inkling for <em>where</em> the thing came from and if you followed the chain high enough you might find where it was originally defined. This <code>Current.person</code> mumbojumbo hides all of that for no real good reason.</p>

<p>Not sure I can state my thoughts clearer than this: <em>DEATH TO GLOBAL STATE.</em></p>

<h2>16:24 - <code>Mention::Scanner</code></h2>

<p>Ok so that <code>Mention::Scanner</code> approach looks pretty good. It&#39;s great that this code wasn&#39;t just thrown into <code>Eavesdropper</code> because it was <em>somewhat</em> related. It&#39;s a separate concern, and moving that logic into <code>Mention::Scanner</code> is a good approach.</p>

<h2>18:10 - <code>Mention</code> <code>after_commit</code> hook</h2>

<p>I still feel strongly that this could just be a method call in the controller after the <code>@bucket.record</code> is called.</p>

<h2>19:20 - <code>ProjectCopier</code> + suppression</h2>

<p>The suppression chain underneath <code>suppress_events_and_deliveries</code> wouldn&#39;t be necessary if this code previously opted-in explicitly to making these &quot;events&quot; and &quot;deliveries&quot;. It <em>still</em> feels like a poor work around for something that could be tidied up with half an hour&#39;s worth of effort.</p>

<p>And at the ~20:10 mark, DHH can&#39;t find where the suppressible behaviour is brought in. This thing where the code is hard-to-navigate  is a massive code smell. Again: if the &quot;callbacks&quot; were explicit rather than implicit, the suppression wouldn&#39;t be needed. The overall code footprint would be smaller, more explicit, and therefore easier to understand. The code does A, B, and C. No magic.</p>

<h2>20:39 - Wrap Up</h2>

<p>&quot;I hope it&#39;s clear&quot; -- it isn&#39;t. I&#39;ve been doing this Rails stuff for <em>10 years</em> now and if I saw this code in a codebase I would look into ways of making this more explicit to make it easier to work with.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said previously: this code feels like &quot;clever code&quot;. &quot;Look at me using all these cool Ruby features! I am so smart!&quot;. Well, yeah. You are smart.</p>

<p>But then in several months time of this thing chugging along working perfectly, you&#39;ll encounter a bug, look at the code and wonder how the hell it all fit together. There is far too much magic here.</p>

<p>But I guess that&#39;s The Rails Way&trade;.</p>

<hr>

<p>20:46: &quot;take all this logic and jam it into, what? The controller? A service object?&quot; -- No. A transaction object (see my example back at 5:55) that created the recording AND explicitly triggered the mention scanner + deliveries.</p>

<p>Another approach would be to use <a href="http://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-transaction/">dry-transaction</a>. This gem provides a very neat DSL for setting up such a thing. I&#39;d imagine it would go like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CreateRecording</span>

<span class="n">step</span> <span class="ss">:create</span>
<span class="n">step</span> <span class="ss">:scan_for_mentions</span>
<span class="n">step</span> <span class="ss">:deliver_notifications</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">bucket: </span><span class="n">bucket</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">.</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="c1"># @bucket.record code goes here</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">scan_for_mentions</span>
  <span class="c1"># MentionScanner goes here</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">deliver_notifications</span>
  <span class="c1"># Delivery code goes here</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It&#39;ll all be wrapped up neatly in the one class. <em>This</em> is where it should go. Not a controller. Not a service object. But a transaction object, that clearly delineates the steps involved in the transaction. There&#39;s no magic here. The steps are run in the order they are specified in. And it&#39;s possible to abort the transaction at each step.</p>

<p>This is my preferred approach. Callbacks and their implicitness have caused so much harm in previous codebases that I would never reach for them again. Transaction objects with explicit orders of operations are what I will be doing instead.</p>
