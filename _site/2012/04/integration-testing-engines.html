        <small>26 Apr 2012</small><br>
        <p>I gave a lightning talk at Railsconf in response to a talk done by Andy Maleh about engines. His talk contained some content that I strongly disagreed with, and so I felt it necessary to set the record straight. You can see the <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/radar/p/integration-testing-engines">slides for it here</a>. I will have a more thorough dissection of the talk once the video is online.</p>

<p>To be perfectly honest, I am probably bitter because I <em>was</em> going to submit a talk about engines and then decided to submit another talk instead which
ultimately didn&#39;t get accepted. Nevertheless...</p>

<h3>Drawing routes</h3>

<p>The first thing that I <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbigg/status/194501115524554754">can recall disagreeing</a> with is Andy&#39;s suggestion to draw routes for the engine on the <code>Rails.application.routes</code> object, by putting
this code inside the <code>config/routes.rb</code> file of the engine:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :people
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>The problem with this is that if the application&#39;s routes file has a catch-all route at the bottom, the route for the engine won&#39;t get matched because it is
drawn after the application. </p>

<p>This leads to additional complexity as well, as by drawing these routes on the application like this, they would also correspond to a controller that&#39;s at the
top-level of the namespace, i.e. <code>PeopleController</code>. This can lead to confusion as to where the controller is located. How can someone know if <code>PeopleController</code> is inside the engine or is inside the application? Furthermore, the more engines that get added to this application, the more confusing such a thing would get.</p>

<p>By namespacing the routes <em>properly</em> (as we do in <a href="https://spreecommerce.com">Spree</a> and <a href="http://github.com/radar/forem">Forem</a>) , like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">Spree::Core::Engine.routes.draw do
  resources :products
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>And by using <code>isolate_namespace</code> inside your engine, the routes will be a completely separate entity for each engine, rather than one big &quot;ball o&#39; mud&quot;. In
Spree this namespace isolation is to the <code>Spree</code> module (i.e. <code>isolate_namespace Spree</code>), so that the controllers will be <code>Spree::ProductsController</code> and not
<code>Spree::Core::ProductsController</code> and the like.</p>

<p>By using a completely isolated namespace like this, your controller would end up being correctly namespaced and then there&#39;s no confusion as to which engine
the controller is located within. You can then mount your engine at whatever path you want inside your application by explicitly defining the mount point
inside <code>config/application.rb</code> like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">mount Spree::Core::Engine, :at =&gt; "/"
</code></pre></div>
<p>By mounting it at root, it will seem as if the engine were a part of the application itself. If you wanted to change where the engine was mounted, it&#39;s a
simple matter of changing the <code>:at</code>: option and you can carry on like normal.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a whole bunch of other stuff that <code>isolate_namespace</code> does as well, like namespacing of models and tables. It&#39;s absolutely important that you namespace
your engine to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>Oh, and one more thing: by doing this namespacing, if you want to get to an engine route from inside the application, you&#39;ll need to call the engine&#39;s routing
proxy method, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">spree.products_path
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you attempted to do <code>products_path</code> it would go to the application&#39;s <code>products_path</code>, which may be undefined.</p>

<p>Similarly, to get to the application&#39;s routes from inside the engine, use <code>main_app</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">main_app.people_path
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Switching back and forth</h3>

<p>The second thing that I disagreed with during Andy&#39;s talk was that he said that when developing an engine you needed to constantly switch back and forth
between the application and the engine. This is simply not true. If you are developing your engine correctly, the development of it can be done in complete
isolation from a real application and instead depend on a dummy application. It should not be a requirement for you to have two separate projects coupled
together like this so you can test one or the other.</p>

<p>How we do it in Forem is that we have a dummy application inside <code>spec/dummy</code> which is generated by running <code>bundle exec rake forem:dummy_app</code>. This
command <a href="https://github.com/radar/forem/blob/master/spec/lib/generators/forem/dummy/dummy_generator.rb">creates a new dummy application</a> with things like
<code>User</code> model already set up inside it. Inside Spree, there&#39;s a similar command called <code>bundle exec rake test_app</code> which <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/core/lib/generators/spree/dummy/dummy_generator.rb">does basically the same thing</a>.</p>

<p>With the dummy application inside the engine, the engine is mounted onto that application and the tests are then run against that application. No need to
switch back and forth from application to engine.</p>

<p>If you have modifications for the engine inside your application, there&#39;s also a way to test that. With Spree, we provide a module called
<code>Spree::Core::UrlHelpers</code> that you can include into your <code>RSpec.configure</code> block like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">require 'spree/core/url_helpers'
RSpec.configure do |c|
  c.include Spree::Core::UrlHelpers, :type =&gt; :integration
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then in your integration tests it&#39;s simply a matter of referencing the Spree routes like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">visit spree.products_path
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now for when you want to test that a customization to a Spree controller is behaving as intended, we&#39;ve got a module for that too. It&#39;s called
<code>Spree::Core::TestingSupport::ControllerRequests</code> and you can include it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">require 'spree/core/testing_support/controller_requests'
RSpec.configure do |c|
  c.include Spree::Core::TestingSupport::ControllerRequests, :type =&gt; :controller
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then you can write your controller specs like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">describe Spree::ProductsController do
  it "can see all the products" do
    spree_get :index
  end
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will then allow you to make requests to the Spree engine from inside your application&#39;s tests.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There&#39;s absolutely no reason to mount engine routes directly on <code>Rails.application.routes</code>, nor is there a requirement to switch back and forth. Integration
testing an engine is extremely easy once you know how to do it.</p>
