        <small>03 Oct 2012</small><br>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/bf0b85472e477f20f84d030c575382b9c0922903/core/app/views/spree/admin/return_authorizations/_form.html.erb#L54-56">These three little lovely lines</a> of very-much obtrusive JavaScript caused a little bit of frustration this afternoon.</p>

<p>What was happening was that in Google Chrome, the page was giving an &quot;aw snap!&quot; error. So I went to Firefox, where the page didn&#39;t &quot;aw snap&quot;, but instead hung for a moment then asked if I wanted to stop the script.</p>

<p>What could that JavaScript be doing? Well, it&#39;s not that hard to understand <em>now</em>, but it didn&#39;t click the first couple of times I read it.</p>

<p>The script initializes a new JavaScript array, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">var variant_prices = new Array();
</code></pre></div>
<p>Fairly innocuous. We would&#39;ve also accepted <code>var variant_prices = [];</code>.</p>

<p>Next, it uses some ERB to go through all the inventory units for an order and then assigns each variant to the array, using the variant&#39;s id <em>as an index in the array</em>. If a variant has an <code>id</code> of say, 1, this is not a problem. Why? Because JavaScript is smart enough to know that it should create a two element with <code>variant_prices[0]</code> being undefined, and <code>variant_prices[1]</code> being whatever value is assigned.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, if the variant&#39;s <code>id</code> is something a little higher, like 1,013,589,413, then you start to run into problems. In that case, JavaScript would create a <strong>one billion, thirteen million, five hundred and eighty-nine thousand, four hundred and fourteen element</strong> array. All to store <em>one</em> value in, right at the end.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is not very efficient and would lead to some performance degredations. Smart browsers would detect this early on and show a vague warning screen and dumber browsers would ask politely if you&#39;d like to stop the script. Which script? Well, they won&#39;t tell you that. You have to play guessing games, like most of the time with the beautiful language that is JavaScript.</p>

<hr>

<p>The <em>now obvious</em> solution to this problem is to <em>not</em> use a JavaScript Array for creating what is obviously a key-value store. Instead, the variable should be initialised like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">var variant_prices = {};
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then you would be assigning keys to the JS object, rather than values at specific indexes in an Array which could have a billion elements.</p>
