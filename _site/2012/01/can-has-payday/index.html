        <small>17 Jan 2012</small><br>
        <p>You may know, if you&#8217;re a frequent reader of this blog, that I am <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2012/01/moving-out-down-to-melbourne/'>moving to
Melbourne</a> soon. How soon? This weekend soon.</p>

<p>In order to move, I&#8217;m going to pack as many of My Things as I can into My Car and then Drive to Melbourne. Simple.</p>

<p>When I get to Melbourne, I am going to unpack My Things from My Car and put them in My Apartment. But I don&#8217;t own enough Things. When I get to my Apartment I will need to buy more Things.</p>

<p>For instance, I will need to buy a saucepan that will become My Saucepan. I may even buy multiple saucepans. I will need to buy a fridge that will be My Fridge. Oh there are so many things that will be Mine.</p>

<p>But to buy all these things, I am going to be relying on a certain batch of money. See, moving out wasn&#8217;t something I planned on doing this soon and so I didn&#8217;t save up enough of My Money to buy more things to be My Things. That was My Mistake, and I know better now.</p>

<p>This little batch of money happens to be payment for <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>My Book</a>, which is owed to me by <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>My Publisher</a>. I have an email here from the 5th of January that asks to confirm the royalty split between myself and My Co-Author, to which I replied almost 30 minutes later.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s another email from Yehuda saying that he should get the money from the copies that were sold before I joined the project, and another shortly after with me agreeing to this. These emails are on the 6th of January.</p>

<p>There is an email on the 6th of January again, from My Publisher&#8217;s Acquisitions Guy that simply states &#8221;I&#8217;ll confirm the count before Ryan joined. Should be pretty easy&#8221;.</p>

<p>Clearly this was not the case, as by the 11th I still had not received My Money that I would dearly like for My Things. I send another email on the 11th asking &#8220;Hey all, how goes the movement on this? I&#8217;m moving into a new place on the 23rd and would love to spend the money on some furniture :)&#8221;.</p>

<p>Yes, I put a smiley face there. It&#8217;s something I do.</p>

<p>Again on the 11th, Yehuda replies with &#8220;Sorry, what works for me. Whatever Michael says the count is fine with me.&#8221;. Okay, so that&#8217;s now an agreement from all parties and an explicit statement that I would like My Money in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Internet and modern banking systems, it shouldn&#8217;t be that difficult.</p>

<p>It is now the 17th January, 12 days since the initial email. 6 days since the confirmation. I am sure, by now, everyone is back from the New Years holidays. And yet&#8230; there&#8217;s still no money. There&#8217;s not even an update saying that My Money is on its way.</p>

<p>While you may think that waiting simply 6 days for a chunk of money is simply being impatient (and you&#8217;d be right), the way I see it is that I&#8217;ve been waiting since the middle of September when My Book was published.</p>

<p>The lack of an update makes me sad. I would really like My Money so I can spend it on more Things to make them become My Things, even going as far as to furnish My Apartment.</p>

<p>But don&#8217;t worry, I have money. It&#8217;s just not My Money. It belongs to Mr Taxman. And if that money isn&#8217;t there when Mr Taxman comes around, then Mr Taxman would not be happy and it&#8217;ll all be a self-perpetuating cycle of unhappiness. This money that belongs to Mr Taxman is kept away from My Money so that I don&#8217;t touch it. It&#8217;s The Golden Rule. I don&#8217;t like to break The Golden Rules.</p>

<p>I just really hope that it doesn&#8217;t turn into <a href='http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/avoid-apress.html'>something like this</a>. Then we&#8217;re all fucked.</p>
