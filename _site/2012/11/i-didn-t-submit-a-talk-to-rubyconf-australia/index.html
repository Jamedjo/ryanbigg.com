        <p>Because I have nothing interesting to talk about.</p>

<p>Honestly: I can&#8217;t think of a single thing that I think would be entertaining for a wide audience to listen to me talk about. I don&#8217;t want to submit a talk based solely on the notion that I&#8217;m supposed to be a mildly-famous member of the Australian Ruby community. What a crap premise to submit a talk on! What on earth could I possibly give a talk about and make informative for a large audience?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to talk about writing a book because I already moan and bitch about that enough on Twitter. Plus, the actual act of writing a book isn&#8217;t <em>exciting</em>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to talk about documentation because nobody gives a crap about proper documentation, save for a very small select group of people and the people who are reading it. Don&#8217;t bullshit me. You know it&#8217;s true.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to talk about engines in general because there&#8217;s already a great guide that covers 95% of what a conference audience needs to know. Chapter 17 of Rails 3 in Action covers it and a bit more also. No point giving a talk about something that&#8217;s already been written about. Personally, I go to conferences to see <em>new, cool and interesting stuff</em>. Not things that I can read about or watch on the Internet.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to talk about my work on Spree because &#8211; and I say this without intending an arrogant tone &#8211; the work itself is self-evident and you don&#8217;t need to hear about it at a conference. I&#8217;m especially <em>not</em> going to talk about my thoughts on how to split up a monolithic <em>engine</em> such as Spree into smaller, easier to manage components. That checkout state machine work that I did? Excuse my brashness, but that was fucking awesome and I&#8217;m so damn proud of it, but I&#8217;m not going to talk about <em>that</em> either. Allowing Spree stores to choose their authentication backend? Please. It was just this thing I did. It doesn&#8217;t deserve a whole conference talk.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m quite happy, this time, to sit there and be an audience member who is learning about all the <em>new, cool and interesting stuff</em> <strong>other</strong> people are doing.</p>
