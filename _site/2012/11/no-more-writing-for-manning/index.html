        <p>As of around this time last week, I am no longer writing for Manning.</p>

<p>This decision has been a long time coming. Ever since I started working for Manning I&#8217;ve had issues with their tooling. I covered these in posts like <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2011/11/don-t-print-hard-copies/'>&#8220;Don&#8217;t print hard-copies&#8221;</a> and <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/the-writing-process/'>&#8220;The Writing Process&#8221;</a>). They&#8217;ve been saying now for <em>two years</em> that they were going to fix it and&#8230; nothing much has been done.</p>

<p>I got so frustrated with their system two weeks in, I decided to write my own. I demonstrate part of Manning&#8217;s system and part of my own, in <a href='https://vimeo.com/45002976'>this short video</a>. I wrote my own review system in a relatively short period of time.</p>

<p>The writing tools are something that I need to use everyday and if they&#8217;re just getting in my way, it totally kills my vibe to write. I don&#8217;t want to hate writing, because I <em>love</em> writing. I love the feeling I get when I can clearly explain something to someone the first time in writing and they just <em>get it</em>.</p>

<p>So, no more writing for Manning because their tools for doing it are terrible. The people at Manning are nothing short of excellent.</p>

<p>Rails 4 in Action <em>will</em> be published by Manning &#8211; they have the rights to the book, not me &#8211; meaning they will need to source another author to do it. For any questions related to that process, contact <a href='support@manning.com'>support@manning.com</a>. They&#8217;ll know more about it than I do.</p>

<p>All of that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ve stopped writing Rails material completely. Oh no no no. You just wait.</p>
