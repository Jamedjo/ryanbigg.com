            <p>As of around this time last week, I am no longer writing for Manning.</p>

<p>This decision has been a long time coming. Ever since I started working for
Manning I&#39;ve had issues with their tooling. I covered these in posts like <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2011/11/don-t-print-hard-copies/">&quot;Don&#39;t print
hard-copies&quot;</a> and <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/the-writing-process/">&quot;The
Writing Process&quot;</a>).
They&#39;ve been saying now for <em>two years</em> that they were going to fix it and...
nothing much has been done.</p>

<p>I got so frustrated with their system two weeks in, I decided to write my own.
I demonstrate part of Manning&#39;s system and part of my own, in <a href="https://vimeo.com/45002976">this short
video</a>. I wrote my own review system in
a relatively short period of time.</p>

<p>The writing tools are something that I need to use everyday and if they&#39;re just
getting in my way, it totally kills my vibe to write. I don&#39;t want to hate
writing, because I <em>love</em> writing. I love the feeling I get when I can clearly
explain something to someone the first time in writing and they just <em>get it</em>.</p>

<p>So, no more writing for Manning because their tools for doing it are terrible.
The people at Manning are nothing short of excellent.</p>

<p>Rails 4 in Action <em>will</em> be published by Manning -- they have the rights to the
book, not me -- meaning they will need to source another author to do it. For
any questions related to that process, contact <a 
href='support@manning.com'>support@manning.com</a>. They&#39;ll know more about it
than I do.</p>

<p>All of that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve stopped writing Rails material completely. Oh no no no. You just wait.</p>
