    <a href="/2010/12/converting-from-wordpress-to-jekyll"><header>Converting from WordPress to Jekyll</header></a>
    <small>27 Dec 2010</small><br>
    <p>Yesterday I converted this blog from WordPress to Jekyll, thanks to some prompting from <a href='http://twitter.com/lenary'>Sam Elliott</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/rohitarondekar'>Rohit Arondekar</a>. All in all, the process wasn&#8217;t actually all that painful. What triggered this whole thing was three factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>My Slicehost server crashed, possibly due to some intense load I was getting from the <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you'>Ubuntu, Ruby, RVM, Rails and You</a> post I wrote (whilst under the influence of delicious cider).</li>

<li>When the server rebooted, I was unable to boot Apache2 back up because <em>somebody</em> (read: me) had fucked with sqlite3 to try to get his IRC bot to work on the server.</li>

<li>Slicehost charged me $38/month for a 512MB box. Linode charges about half that for the same thing. Fuck Slicehost.</li>
</ul>

<p>So off I went on a magical journey to fix these three problems.</p>

<h3 id='never_work_on_live_systems'>Never work on live systems</h3>

<p>A rule that every developer has to learn the hard way (be it from anywhere to their own system up to a website with a couple of hundred users) is that you <strong>never ever, ever, ever work on live systems because something will go terribly, terribly wrong</strong>. The second rule that every developer learns is <strong>backups, motherfucker, do you have them?</strong>. So when I had 3 years of posts that I didn&#8217;t want to lose I obeyed these two rules.</p>

<h3 id='wordpress_conversion'>Wordpress conversion</h3>

<p>First task was to take an SQL backup from the WordPress install that I had and move it over to my own system. Next, I imported this SQL into a local install of MySQL and made sure it was the latest-and-greatest. Sure, enough it was. Rohit had pointed me at the <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations'>Blog migrations wiki page</a> for Jekyll and it had what appeared to be clear instructions for WordPress there.</p>

<p>So I cloned the <a href='http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a> project into my <code>~/Sites/gems</code> folder and ran just the wordpress commands because I have tunnel vision when reading documentation (note: not my real username and password):</p>

<pre><code>$ export DB=ryanbigg
$ export USER=lolno 
$ export PASS=nopass4u 
$ ruby -r &#39;~/Sites/gems/jekyll/lib/jekyll/migrators/wordpress&#39; -e &#39;Jekyll::WordPress.process( &quot;#{ENV[&quot;DB&quot;]}&quot;, &quot;#{ENV[&quot;USER&quot;]}&quot;, &quot;#{ENV[&quot;PASS&quot;]}&quot;)&#39;</code></pre>

<p>To my surprise, it worked. I had a whole bunch of <code>_posts</code> files representing the posts in my system.</p>

<h3 id='booting_jekyll'>Booting Jekyll</h3>

<p>I installed the <code>jekyll</code> gem itself using <code>gem install jekyll</code> and then ran <code>jekyll --server</code> and it threw up a ton of &#8220;errors&#8221;, which actually turned out to be warnings about my ability to sometimes intersperse invalid HTML / Markdown with valid Markdown (or the other way around). When I went to http://localhost:4000 I got a 403 error. So I checked out other Jekyll blogs like <a href='http://github.com/qrush/litanyagainstfear'>Nick Quaranto's litanyagainstfear repository</a> to see what I was missing. I instantly came across the <a href='https://github.com/qrush/litanyagainstfear/blob/master/index.html'>index.html</a> file in this repository and &#8220;borrowed&#8221; it for my own blog, turning it into <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/master/index.html'>what's now here</a>. I choose to only show the last 25 posts because everything before that is ancient history. The links to them will still work, but I&#8217;m just not showing them in the archive list to conserve space.</p>

<h3 id='stylin'>Stylin&#8217;</h3>

<p>The next thing I needed to do was to create a <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/master/_layouts/default.html'>default.html layout</a> file in the <code>_layouts</code> folder to style this new home page of mine. I created a <code>css</code> folder at the root of the project and put in <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/master/css/style.css'>`style.css`</a> and got to work styling it. I wanted something a little more lightweight than the old theme and I think what I came up with was alright. This morning I added a <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/master/css/mobile.css'>`mobile.css`</a> which should format the blog just fine for mobile screens. It looks great on my iPhone 4.</p>

<h3 id='comments'>Comments</h3>

<p>I wanted to keep the comments from the WordPress site and Rohit recommended Disqus as a way to do that. I installed the <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disqus-comment-system/'>WordPress plugin</a> for it and followed the bouncing ball and had my comments exported to Disqus in no time. I needed to add the following to the <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/0c30ab8b5b9721b16fa125d94270d797d4eb556e/_layouts/post.html#L16-30'>post layout</a> to support the Disqus comment system. The <code>wordpress_id</code> field is the &#8220;secret sauce&#8221; here for how Disqus knows which post links up to what comments. The only caveat I&#8217;ve been informed about for Disqus is that the comments won&#8217;t be indexed by Google because they&#8217;re loaded via a JavaScript request, but I can tolerate that. Any useful information I would put in a post, probably.</p>

<h3 id='wordpress_pages'>WordPress pages</h3>

<p>To convert over the pages from WordPress that weren&#8217;t posts I&#8217;ve copied the source of them (such as the <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/about-me.html'>About me</a> page) and put them as static HTML files in the root of the project. When Jekyll compiles the site, these are copied over to the <code>_site</code> directory.</p>

<h3 id='deployment'>Deployment</h3>

<p>Currently going via the low-tech method of an SSH + <code>git pull</code> on the server, but hoping to switch to a commit hook in the future.</p>

<h3 id='benefits'>Benefits</h3>

<p>The benefits are many. My posts are now <a href='http://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com'>open source</a> which means that if people find problems with them that can send in pull requests, but that&#8217;s just a pipe dream probably.</p>

<p>The main benefit is the speed. On the vanilla WordPress install I had I was lucky to get 2 requests per second for the home page. With Jekyll, I&#8217;m getting about 2,300 reqests per second. This is due to the fact all my posts are static assets now. I think I could double this if I <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2009/06/how-to-make-your-rails-application-578-times-faster/'>switched to Nginx</a>, which I plan on doing when I don&#8217;t have a use for the PHP version anymore.</p>

<p>I also get to write my posts the way I like to: Markdown + HTML. No crummy little editor window, I can do it all from within TextMate.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really liking Jekyll as lightweight alternative to WordPress and it&#8217;s great to finally be off a PHP-based system. I mean, if Ruby is so good <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here'>why would I be using a PHP based system?</a></p>
