        <p>Hi there, my parents and friends call me Ryan Bigg, but you may know me as "Radar". Either is fine.</p>
        <p>I'm a technical writer for Ruby / Rails based in Australia. I have written a Rails book with <a href="http://yehudakatz.com">Yehuda Katz</a> called <a href="http://manning.com/katz">Rails 3 in Action</a>, which is available also on <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Rails-3-Action-Ryan-Bigg/dp/1935182277'>Amazon</a>.

            I won a <a href='http://rubyheroes.com'>Ruby Hero</a> award in 2011 for my work on documentation for Rails. I keep some guides in my <a href='http://github.com/radar/guides'>guides</a> repository on GitHub. As part of this documentation, I've worked on the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html'>Asset Pipeline</a>, <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html'>Active Record Query Interface</a>, <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html'>Configuring Rails Applications</a> and the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html'>Rails Initialization Internals</a> guides. I've also been known to hang out on <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/users/15245/ryan-bigg'>Stack Overflow</a>.
          </p>
          <p> Occasionally I find some time to write interesting blog posts such as the ones you see below.</p>
          <p>I also have done quite a lot of <a href="http://github.com/radar">open-source work</a> and I <a href="http://twitter.com/ryanbigg">tweet</a>. Find out more <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/about-me">about me</a>.</p>

    <a href="/2011/11/the-rails-api"><header>The Rails API</header></a>
    <small>14 Nov 2011</small><br>
    <p>Recently, the Rails API got a facelift. Gone is the boring and dull blue four-frame-set API that once was. Now we have a dual-framed red API instead. The colours are good, I&#8217;ll give it that. Take a look at it:</p>
<img src='images/rails-api/original.png' />
<p>Notice anything wrong?</p>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s take away some things until you start thinking it&#8217;s wrong. How about we take out that &#8220;RDOC_MAIN.rdoc&#8221; string &#8211; both instances &#8211; and we made the version more prominent? We&#8217;ll also get rid of the last modified timestamp, as a date is more friendly to people. Making these simple changes, we&#8217;ll get this:</p>
<img src='images/rails-api/title-changes.png' />
<p>Right. That&#8217;s a little better now. It&#8217;s clearer what the purpose of this page is and when it was last updated. We don&#8217;t care that the README is in a file called &#8220;RDOC_MAIN.rdoc&#8221;, and so we&#8217;ve removed it. Simple.</p>

<p>Now what else don&#8217;t we need? Well, when we go to the API we&#8217;re most likely going to want to find information about the methods provided by Rails. So why have the README there at all? While it&#8217;s a good placeholder for the content, that&#8217;s all it is: a placeholder. The main focus of the API site should be what we want to do on it: search for things. If you want to read the README, there&#8217;s <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails'>better (and more standard) places for that</a>, quite simply.</p>

<p>With the README gone, we&#8217;re going to have this gigantic void of empty, useless space. With this change, the main feature of the API, the searching, is almost hidden up in the top-left hand corner. So let&#8217;s make that more prominent.</p>

<p>Is that menu underneath it really useful? It contains an awfully large amount of items in it. Do people really care about that? Isn&#8217;t searching for something a much easier way to find it? I&#8217;d say so.</p>

<p>So we remove the README, we remove the menu, we make the search more prominent. What are we left with?</p>
<img src='images/rails-api/search-box.png' />
<p>The title, the date the API was last updated and a box to search. There&#8217;s no mystery to what this box does: it says &#8220;Search&#8221; on it. It could also say &#8220;Search the Rails API&#8221;. Anybody should be able to figure out that you can search the API using this box.</p>

<p>But there&#8217;s no button! There doesn&#8217;t need to be a button, though. When a person searches, it will autocomplete their search and show the matching results from the API. You could even go a step further and weight certain results, so that things like <s>`ActiveRecord::Base`</s>, um, excuse me, <code>ActiveRecord::FinderMethods</code>&#8217;s <code>find</code> method appears before <code>ActiveResource::Base</code>.</p>

<p>Further more, you could get a search for &#8220;match&#8221; to show the routing (<code>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Base</code>) <code>match</code> method prominently, and the other <code>match</code> (like the one in <code>HTML::Selector</code>) methods less prominently, perhaps in a grey colour instead of black.</p>

<p>Anything wrong with this now? I think not. The API is less confusing and more prominently displays the function that most people use it for.</p>
<hr />
<p>That&#8217;s my vision for the future of the Rails API. I know it probably won&#8217;t get to that stage, as there&#8217;s large technical hurdles in the way (such as indexing the entire documentation for Rails into a searchable format), but I think that it&#8217;s still possible.</p>

<p>So this weekend I dove into some <a href='http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/'>Backbone.js</a> with the help of <a href='http://twitter.com/joeybeninghove'>Joey Beninghove's</a> <a href='http://backbonescreencasts.com/'>great Backbone.js screencasts</a> and built this idea. There&#8217;s also a bit of the Twitter Bootstrap in use, which makes things pretty.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s called <a href='http://radar.github.com/sume'>Sume</a> and looks like this:</p>
<img src='/images/sume.png' />
<p>It&#8217;s just a proof-of-concept of this Rails API idea, allowing you to search for only a handful of classes and methods at the moment. But it presents it in a neat format.</p>

<p>Ah, and one more thing: it gives you a unique URL for each page, which is something the current Rails API <em>doesn&#8217;t do</em>. When you make a request to <a href='http://radar.github.com/sume/#search/ActiveSupport::Concern'>the link for
ActiveSupport::Concern</a> it actually takes you right to those docs. This makes it easy to link it to other people.</p>
