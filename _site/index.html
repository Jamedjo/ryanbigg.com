        <p>Hi there, my parents and friends call me Ryan Bigg, but you may know me as "Radar". Either is fine.</p>
        <p>I'm a technical writer for Ruby / Rails based in Australia. I have written a Rails book with <a href="http://yehudakatz.com">Yehuda Katz</a> called <a href="http://manning.com/katz">Rails 3 in Action</a>, which is available also on <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Rails-3-Action-Ryan-Bigg/dp/1935182277'>Amazon</a>.

          I won a <a href='http://rubyheroes.com'>Ruby Hero</a> award in 2011 for my work on documentation for Rails. I keep some guides in my <a href='http://github.com/radar/guides'>guides</a> repository on GitHub. As part of this documentation, I've worked on the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html'>Asset Pipeline</a>, <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html'>Active Record Query Interface</a>, <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html'>Configuring Rails Applications</a>, <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html'>Getting Started with Engines</a> and the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html'>Rails Initialization Internals</a> guides. I've also been known to hang out on <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/users/15245/ryan-bigg'>Stack Overflow</a>.

    <a href="/2012/11/i-didn-t-submit-a-talk-to-rubyconf-australia"><header>I didn't submit a talk to RubyConf Australia</header></a>
    <small>01 Nov 2012</small><br>
    <p>Because I have nothing interesting to talk about.</p>

<p>Honestly: I can&#8217;t think of a single thing that I think would be entertaining for a wide audience to listen to me talk about. I don&#8217;t want to submit a talk based solely on the notion that I&#8217;m supposed to be a mildly-famous member of the Australian Ruby community. What a crap premise to submit a talk on! What on earth could I possibly give a talk about and make informative for a large audience?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to talk about writing a book because I already moan and bitch about that enough on Twitter. Plus, the actual act of writing a book isn&#8217;t <em>exciting</em>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to talk about documentation because nobody gives a crap about proper documentation, save for a very small select group of people and the people who are reading it. Don&#8217;t bullshit me. You know it&#8217;s true.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to talk about engines in general because there&#8217;s already a great guide that covers 95% of what a conference audience needs to know. Chapter 17 of Rails 3 in Action covers it and a bit more also. No point giving a talk about something that&#8217;s already been written about. Personally, I go to conferences to see <em>new, cool and interesting stuff</em>. Not things that I can read about or watch on the Internet.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to talk about my work on Spree because &#8211; and I say this without intending an arrogant tone &#8211; the work itself is self-evident and you don&#8217;t need to hear about it at a conference. I&#8217;m especially <em>not</em> going to talk about my thoughts on how to split up a monolithic <em>engine</em> such as Spree into smaller, easier to manage components. That checkout state machine work that I did? Excuse my brashness, but that was fucking awesome and I&#8217;m so damn proud of it, but I&#8217;m not going to talk about <em>that</em> either. Allowing Spree stores to choose their authentication backend? Please. It was just this thing I did. It doesn&#8217;t deserve a whole conference talk.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m quite happy, this time, to sit there and be an audience member who is learning about all the <em>new, cool and interesting stuff</em> <strong>other</strong> people are doing.</p>
