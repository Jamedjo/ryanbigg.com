  (Inspired by
  <a href="http://nownownow.com/about">Derek Siver's /now page movement</a>) --
  Last updated 14th November 2018.

<p class="large">
  I'm a husband and new dad, to a daughter (Ella) born in September 2016. Being
  a dad is very awesome. Seeing a little human grow is the most amazing thing.
  Ella is very good at communicating and running now! She's just learned that
  she can raise her eyebrows, which is hilarious.
</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>
  When I'm not husband-ing or dad-ing I'm working full-time at
  <a href="http://cultureamp.com">Culture Amp</a>. I'm the Junior Engineering
  Program Lead there. We've just finished a round of hiring, and the next cohort
  (JEP #2) starts in January. In the meantime, I'm planning out the first 6
  weeks of curriculum, focussing on browser tech (HTML, CSS & JS) first, then
  moving from there to Ruby, databases, and Rails. The program will run for 9
  months total.
</p>

<p>
  You can read my
  <a href="/2018/08/junior-engineering-program-resources"
    >notes on the first JEP program here</a
  >.
</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>

<p>
  In my spare time, I'm continuing to write
  <a href="https://joyofelixir.com">Joy of Elixir</a>. This book is a gentle
  introduction to programming for first-timers, teaching them the ways of
  Elixir. Why I'm writing it is best explained by it
  <a href="https://joyofelixir.com/about.html">about page</a>. Last now update I
  said I would have this finished by the end of 2018. It's mostly there. Maybe
  it might get done by then. But also, maybe not.
</p>

<h3>Life</h3>

<p>
  As we get toward the end of the year, I'm looking forward to taking some time
  off over Christmas and spending that time with my extended family.
