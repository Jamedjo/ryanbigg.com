        <small>06 Jul 2008</small><br>
        <p>Thanks to the guys at NetFox (Yuji or Adam) for the name for this post.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I go to the dentist to have empty wallet (read: root canal) treatment (hereafter referred to as EWT). My tooth that broke at Railscamp has a serious bout of decay in it no thanks to me not caring for my teeth as I really should have, for quite too long. Consider this a warning to all the readers of this blog to look after your teeth. It&#39;s going to cost me a fair bit (thankfully I save money, rather than spend), and thanks to a complete lack of Dental insurance I&#39;ll be paying through the nose (or is that the mouth?). I am not in any way looking foward to the needles (notice the plural!) that are going to be going into my gum tomorrow morning. The best part is that a client is coming in tomorrow at 10:30 and I&#39;m one of the people working on their project, so I&#39;ll be [attempting to] speak with them. Perhaps I could type and get the text-to-speech voice on the MBP to read it out, or something.</p>

<p>Look after your teeth, please. You are not invincible, and neither am I.</p>
