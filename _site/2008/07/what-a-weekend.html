        <small>25 Jul 2008</small><br>
        <p>And it hasn&#39;t even begun!</p>

<p>Here I sit on a Friday night, on my bed with two quilts over the lower-half of my body. Sitting by the open window (yes, open. Even though it&#39;s winter and 7.7 celcius outside) on my bed with my laptop on top of the quilts. My mum&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s son sits on the only chair in the room, using UberComputer and playing Spore Creature Creator, creating a dinosaur like creature. I feel relaxed, probably due to me getting off work a bit earlier than usual because the internet was balls (dialup had better ping times), and I know that there&#39;s going to be a lot of stuff to do on the weekend.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I&#39;m going to be attending <a href='http://avcon.org.au'>AVCon</a>, not because I like dressing up in a Sailor Moon costume (not that I&#39;m going to of course), I just want to see what all the fuss is about. Two of my friends (Brenton and James) have both recommended in one way or another that I go, so I&#39;m going. Hopefully I&#39;ll enjoy myself, but it is an <b>anime</b> andvideogames conference, and I&#39;m not all that in to anime... </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been tasked (is this the correct word?) to host Railscamp #4! I have an idea for a venue and I&#39;m going to check it out on Sunday. Hopefully if all goes according to plan there should be a formal announcement soonish. Price and what not is not worked out yet, but I have a good idea and I&#39;m not going to tell you! I&#39;ll have a better idea Sunday night, if I can be bothered blogging about it.</p>

<p>See you on the other side!</p>

<p>EDIT: I didn&#39;t go to AvCon (thanks for answering my calls James!), instead I scoped out the venue for Railscamp #4, went cruising with Devastator in the epic quest for computer parts and generally lazed about like all decent people [should] do on a weekend.</p>
