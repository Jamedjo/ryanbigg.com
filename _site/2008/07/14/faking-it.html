    <p>Today I was doing the one thing I truly, truly love doing and that&#8217;s complaining about writing RSpec tests. I came across a doozy of a problem involving RSpec testing and faking subdomains. Here&#8217;s a stripped down version of what I did:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
def login_as(user)
  session["user"] = users(user).id
  request.host = User.find(session["user"]).company.domain + ".example.com"
end
</pre>
<p>Just pop that into your <em>spec/spec_helper.rb</em> and then you can use <span class='term'>login_as(:user)</span> which will find the fixture with the name of &#8220;user&#8221; and then go from there to setting your faked host as being from, for example, blah.example.com.</p>

<p>Pretty simple, shame Google didn&#8217;t turn up any relevant results without me having to dig deeper than usual.</p>
