    <p>I read Mike Gunderloy&#8217;s blog post today and afterwards thought he was crazy! I thought you couldn&#8217;t do <span class='term'>Blog.find("1-title")</span>.</p>

<p>But you can.</p>

<p>If you pass in 1-title as <span class='term'>params[:id]</span> for any action and then pass it to <span class='term'>find</span>, <span class='term'>find</span> will do its &#8220;thing&#8221; and just execute <span class='term'>find(1)</span>, giving you pretty URLs AND pretty code.</p>

<p>I later found out this was because find just calls <span class='term'>to_i</span> when it gets given strings, and calling it on &#8220;1-title&#8221; will give you &#8220;1&#8221;.</p>
