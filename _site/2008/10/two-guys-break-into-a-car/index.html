        <p>Well, I&#8217;ll assume it was two. Some idiot(s) in the middle of the night smashed the corner of my back-right window and rifled through my car looking for something. Obviously they didn&#8217;t find it because the car is still there. They changed the gearstick to reverse, took off the handbrake and moved an American flag I had in the boot into the backseat (I know! The outrage!). Everything&#8217;s still in the car, just in more disarray than usual.</p>
