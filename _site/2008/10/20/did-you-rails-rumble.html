<p>I spent the weekend learning (read: having an affair with) Merb. I&#8217;m porting <a href='http://github.com/radar/rboard'>rboard</a> to <a href='http://github.com/radar/mboard'>mboard</a> whenever I feel like doing some merb. This is in the interest of seeing how much merb actually kicks Rails&#8217; ass and a learning experience for me.</p>

<p>Also, Merb&#8217;s source code is very, very pretty.</p>
