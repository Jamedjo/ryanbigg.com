        <p>Occasionally when I&#39;m moving my head I get these throat cramps just on the right side of my throat. During these cramping phases the muscle (?) that moves up and down when you swallow (have a look in the mirror and watch your throat as you swallow, you&#39;ll know what I mean) is what cramps. This can be extremely painful and I know of nobody else who gets these. I can only describe it as a cramp. There is a large sharp pain (kind of like when you get hit in the throat) when swallowing and a slightly lesser pain when I tilt my head backwards or to the left. Again, this only happens on one side of my throat.</p>

<p>I was prescribed anti-histamine tablets last year for this problem and it&#39;s only manifested itself 4 times since then, the last 2 times have been within a month of each other. Generally, tilting my head back and drinking about a litre of water helps, but not the last two times. The last two times I&#39;ve had to wait it out, and it&#39;s been 3 hours and 1 hour respectively.</p>

<p>Has anybody out there in the blogosphere heard of this before?</p>
