    <a href='http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html'>Zed Shaw (Mongrel creator, amongst other awesome things) had a small rant about Rails and how he's been fucked over in the world, aka Rails is a Ghetto.
</a>
<p>Compared to <a href='http://frozenplague.net/?p=105'>my last rant,</a> Zed is a ranting king. He makes it sound so convincing, but most of the article is about behind-the-scenes politics.</p>

<p>Made for an interesting read.</p>
