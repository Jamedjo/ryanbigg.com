    <p>I <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/c2dbbe50997badbf'>replied to a job advertisement</a> on the rubyonrails-talk mailing list, explaining that all job advertisements look the same:</p>

<p>I would only dream that somebody will produce a job advertisement that does not copy the same style as all the others. Someone needs to break free of the mould. If I hear or read another buzzword in a job advertisement I&#8217;ll go postal.</p>

<p>In other news, there was<a href='http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?pid=50334#p50334'> a post on Rails Forum by pullmonkey</a> who gave a rather helpful roundup method. His method lets you round up to the nearest 1o. <a href='http://pastie.caboo.se/137544'>I altered his code some</a> and added in a new method called rounddown which will round it down to the nearest multiple of whatever argument you pass in.</p>
