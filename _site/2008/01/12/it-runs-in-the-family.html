    <p>Tom is known to be not the smartest person in the world, and I thought, well maybe it&#8217;s just Tom. Today I was proven that it actually runs in his family. His Aunty Mary stayed over for a week at his house, and left a few things behind including a small keyring with a light on it, a mouse, a keyboard, and a laptop. Yes, a laptop.</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s mum came home and later on phoned up Aunty Mary and the conversation went a bit like this:</p>
<strong>Tom's Mum: </strong><strong>Mary: </strong><strong>Tom's Mum:</strong><strong>Mary: </strong><strong>Tom's Mum: </strong><strong>Mary: </strong><strong>Tom's Mum: </strong><strong>Mary: </strong>
