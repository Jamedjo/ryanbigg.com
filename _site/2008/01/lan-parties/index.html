        <p>I went to the Reloaded festival over the weekend just gone, it was awesome save for the lack of toilets (2 between 400 != good) and complete lack of decently quiet, not bright, comfortable sleeping area and the idiot who made the police come in. A bit tough on the mind, as I was still a tad zombified yesterday, but now I&#8217;m back up to normal. Wookie did a wonderful job with the event even though people will always find something to complain about (and did). The main complaint was that the competitions were not ran on time, or ran way overtime (i.e. the CS:S grand final ending hours after the event was supposed to finish)</p>
<a href='http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/sets/72157603816659975/'> I didn't take as many photos as last time,</a>
<p>There was some Team Fortress 2 playing as well, which is now my favourite game (having racked up ~24 hours on it, I might also be addicted) which was fun listening to people shouting out as well as sending back a few insults of my own.</p>

<p>It was incredibly fun and I won&#8217;t blog about it too much here because there&#8217;s too much to blog about. If you want to know what other people thought there is <a href='http://valhalla.net.au/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=11218&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a'>a thread on the valhalla forums</a> and <a href='http://www.reloadedlan.com/r3/index.php?topic=717.0'>one on the reloaded forums</a>.</p>
