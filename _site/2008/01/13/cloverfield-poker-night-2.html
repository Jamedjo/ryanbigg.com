    <p>I&#8217;m going to go see the movie Cloverfield on Friday night.</p>

<p>Wednesday is my sister&#8217;s wedding, and I don&#8217;t get back until Thursday.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;m planning on holding a poker night on Saturday night at my house, starting at 7. People have already expressed interest in it and I hope it&#8217;ll be as good as a turn out as last time.</p>
