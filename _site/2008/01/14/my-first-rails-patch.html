    <p>I was infuriated at this method over the weekend when I found out that it didn&#8217;t use the current year, but instead always guessed Feb. to be 28 days regardless of the current year. My patch uses the current year.</p>

<p>+1 it if you think it&#8217;s a good idea.</p>

<p>This patch is now verified! This means that it will be more than likely to be included inside of Rails 2.1, whenever that&#8217;s released! Thanks to DevF and nzkoz from #rails-contrib on freenode for suggesting that I write tests as well as telling me a cool few tricks.</p>

<p>This patch is now in Rails! <a href='http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/8715'>http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/8715 </a></p>
