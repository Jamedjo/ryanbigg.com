        <p>A friend asked if I wanted to go to a party and I 202, and said 200. When we got there I asked for a glass of water, only to be given a 400 instead. So I asked for a Coke and the reply was 402, so I 202.</p>

<p>My phone rang but all I got was 206, thanks to the totally rad phone coverage in the venue. So I limited myself talking to people around me. Ended up talking my friend&#8217;s girlfriend who complained about her boyfriend&#8217;s 411 (or possible 410), and her suspicions he may be 101. I mentioned about my 413 and she gave back 402. The boyfriend overheard and we got into a 409, he said what I was doing was 406 (or was that 405?). He said that he&#8217;d be 303&#8217;ing from now on, and she said she&#8217;d already 302 another. I said that I had 300, to which she shrugged.</p>

<p>I grabbed some appetisers from a passing tray, only for later on that night to have a 500 and I 502&#8217;d the appetisers. The party was a 417!</p>
