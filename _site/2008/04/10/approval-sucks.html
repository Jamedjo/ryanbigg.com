    <p>I removed comment approval on the site, so now when you post a comment it will show up immediately, rather than having to wait for approval. Yeah, it may be abused, but it&#8217;s really easy to switch it back.</p>

<p>On a completely unrelated topic (due to the fact I&#8217;d have to go to posts and click the &#8220;Write Post&#8221; button again), another telemarketer called today and I gave her that old &#8221;<a href='http://frozenplague.net/2008/03/25/telemarketers-2'>I'm a government agency</a>, don&#8217;t call this number&#8221;. Hook line and sinker. &#8220;Oh, very sorry sir. You will never be contacted again by this campaign.&#8221; &#8220;I would prefer never again.&#8221; I replied shortly before she wished me well and hung up. 100% success rate.</p>
