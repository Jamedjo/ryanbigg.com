    <p>I&#8217;m sure that if you help out people and live in the help channels of the multitude of IRC servers on the interwebs that you&#8217;re sick of telling people to &#8220;JFGI&#8221; or &#8220;Just Fucking Google It&#8221;, and then end up googling it yourself to provide them with a link so they can go away.</p>

<p>So I created the mIRC alias script known only as &#8220;google&#8221;. Type /google &#60;query&#62; to get a url like <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=rails+2.0+scaffolding'>http://www.google.com/search?q=rails+2.0+scaffold</a>. Chuck the following in your alias file and never have to google anything again!</p>
<code>
jfgi {
/msg $active http://www.google.com/search?q= $+ $replace($1-,$chr(32),+)
}
</code>
<p>I originally had this posted as &#8220;google&#8221; but apparently users of NoNameScript already have a google alias, so I changed it for them.</p>
