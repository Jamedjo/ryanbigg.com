        <p>No, I&#8217;m not mimicing what the heavy says in Team Fortress 2 when a Pyro has freshly set him alight, I&#8217;m doing something that&#8217;s not TF2! Coding PHP!</p>

<p>After living in a fantasy world of Ruby on Rails for around 8 months, and then jumping straight back into PHP at the niggling, horribly maintained <a href='http://pulse.offbeat-zero.net'>Whatpulse Signature Images site</a> and it was like jumping into a vat of Sulphuric Acid, not that I know what that&#8217;s like.</p>

<p>Lets lead off with a few bad things:</p>
<strong>1. Mother-fucking semi-colons </strong>
<p>What. The. Fuck. Why do I have to end my lines with semi-colons? There&#8217;s been about a hundred times (it feels it) TODAY that I&#8217;ve been caught out because I&#8217;ve missed a semi-colon somewhere.</p>
<strong>2. Brackets</strong>
<p>Why does my if statement need to have ( and ) around the argument? Isn&#8217;t the text after the if ALWAYS the argument? Why the hell does it need curly brackets too?</p>
<strong>3. Coding in Notepad++</strong>
<p>Yay for no syntax highlighting and only <strong>bolding</strong> the ending bracket or parenthesis. It&#8217;s REALLY hard to tell the difference between <strong>}</strong> and } in Monaco. Same with Courier New.</p>

<p>Yay for also 8-months-ago Ryan not knowing how <strong>truly bloody awesome </strong>line indentation is and how much it makes code easier to read. Thanks for Adam for making his code more readable than mine. The guy&#8217;s a PHP God. He probably solves advanced calculus equations <strong>simultaneously, for fun.</strong></p>

<p>Enough ranting. Got to go try out this crap known as &#8220;Eclipse PDT&#8221; to see if it&#8217;s better than Notepad++.</p>
