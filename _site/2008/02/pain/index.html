        <p>Today I went on a bike ride, I had originally planned to ride from <a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;saddr=Adelaide&amp;daddr=-34.826205,138.694496+to:Elizabeth+East&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=12&amp;via=1&amp;sll=-34.8253,138.637695&amp;sspn=0.205174,0.32135&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-34.830714,138.661194&amp;spn=0.410321,0.6427&amp;z=11'>Adelaide to Elizabeth</a> but Tom decided he wasn&#8217;t going to go so I&#8217;d thought I&#8217;d just make it up as I went along. I changed my idea to<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=21828087726211148,-34.833179,138.693705&amp;saddr=Adelaide&amp;daddr=-34.832792,138.694539&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=15&amp;sll=-34.834131,138.699603&amp;sspn=0.025644,0.040169&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-34.8772,138.672867&amp;spn=0.205045,0.32135&amp;z=12'> Adelaide to the other end of the Obahn (Tea Tree Gully) </a>and back, but took a few detours along the way and actually did something <a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=7331289563892780050,-34.884350,138.637790%3B8830481223806189783,-34.871944,138.636153&amp;saddr=Adelaide&amp;daddr=Athelstone+to:Og+Rd+%40-34.884350,+138.637790+to:NE+Rd+%40-34.871944,+138.636153+to:Adelaide&amp;mra=pi&amp;mrcr=2&amp;via=2&amp;sll=-34.886494,138.632355&amp;sspn=0.051255,0.080338&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-34.899448,138.647118&amp;spn=0.102495,0.160675&amp;z=13'>more like this.</a> I could not show the exact path as google maps does not yet do the Linear Park trail. Thankfully, Mr. GPS does and it&#8217;s telling me that I did 40.7km today, and I&#8217;m proud of that fact. I got burnt <em>again</em> and that irritates me for not taking my sunscreen with me.</p>

<p>I am in a moderate amount of pain right now and I know tomorrow will be a day of almost complete stiffness, so if you want me to do anything for you that involves pedalling, running, jumping, throwing, catching or generally moving my legs and arms fast or lifting heavy items, it can wait.</p>

<p>The Torrens looked its most disgusting and it&#8217;s now a string of puddles and ponds more than a river. I say we rename the whole thing to &#8220;The Chain of Ponds Formerly Known As The River Torrens&#8221;! And to think! This is what the Murray&#8217;s going to look like if the government doesn&#8217;t pick up their game.</p>

<p>In other news, I took some not-so-pretty pictures of <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/2290340711/'>Thomo</a>, <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/2291132702/'>Paul</a> and <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/2291135780/'>Kello </a>(somehow Joe escaped the lens) at the last Poker Night. There&#8217;s also a picture of <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/2276461478/'>my uncleaned keyboard.</a></p>

<p>I took some pretty pictures today on my ride: <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/2290352527/'>a flower</a>, <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/2290347125/'>the suspension bridge</a>, <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/2290348885/'>the dryness of the Torrens</a> and <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/2291137692/'>the convention centre.</a></p>
