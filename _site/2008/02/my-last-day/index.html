        <p>It&#8217;s been a while, but two Fridays ago was my last day working for SeaLink, well, for this contract anyway. You never know if I might get a new contract with them further down the road and I would love to come back and work with those amazing people.</p>

<p>I completed their online bookings &#8220;module&#8221; for their site as the last thing I did before I left, and it seemed they really appreciate it. I even got a better card than what Coles gave me, this one was actually bought from a shop instead of written hastily on receipt paper. Written in it was: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

<p>&#8220;Dear Ryan Best of Luck. Who will Elise and I argue with no? Keep in touch to let us know what&#8217;s next. Ems (Emma)&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Ryan, Wishing you all the very best with your next adventure! It was lovely to work with you. Now put your shoes back on! Elise&#8221;&lt;/blockquote&gt; I look forward to catching up with these guys again in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>P.S. The shoes reference is I used to take my shoes off when it got really hot as I feel I work better without wearing sweaty shoes. I also used to walk 2km to work every day. <blockquote /></p>
