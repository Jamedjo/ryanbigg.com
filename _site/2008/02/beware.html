        <small>04 Feb 2008</small><br>
        <p>Today I visited a place I have only visited around three times. It&#39;s plain and boring and generally you only ever go there to lose a lot of money very quickly so you can move around faster (legally) than if you never gave that money away. I made a terrible, terrible mistake by going in at lunchtime. The line was half way to the back of the place and by the time I reached the front the line extended out of it, and then more. I filled out a form with my details on it.</p>

<p>I sat down and read a book, a 70-something page book, whilst little children squealed and bashed trolleys against the bench. I watched as a grown man was pleading with the police to &quot;stop breaking my arms dudes!&quot; as he was escorted out. I finished the book, extremely bored with what I just read and let&#39;s just say it wasn&#39;t a<em> Lord of the Rings</em> or <em>Curse of the Chosen</em>.</p>

<p>I lined up again in the almost-impossibly long line that was moving even more impossibly slower, thankful that it wasn&#39;t my child that was making all that racquet. If only there were noise laws against children and people talking on mobile phones obnoxiously loud. The line shuffled forward, ever slowly. I reached the front and was told to fill out yet another form with my details on it (maybe they just <em>really</em> need to make sure it was me?) and to walk over to the other counter with a piece of paper.</p>

<p>I waited whilst a man of asian appearance argued with one of the staff about the identity of his wife (she had a different last name on her passport) and thankfully another staffer came over and assisted me. He told me to sit down at a desk, walked around a corner and asked if I could see anything. I said I couldn&#39;t, and he disappeared for a few more seconds. Something came up on the screen and he asked if I could see anything, and I politely (but nervously) replied that I could.</p>

<p>I touched the screen and followed the instructions, I focussed eagerly, and at times I suspect on the wrong things and pressed the screen when I was told to. After a few minutes of doing this and listening to the asian man still get more frustrated about the identity of his wife, I completed it.</p>

<p>I was congratulated, and asked to fill yet another form about my identity (maybe they just <em>really really</em> needed to make sure it was me) and walked out of there with a smile on my face and two pieces of paper in my hand.</p>

<p>I did my Hazard Perception Test. I passed first go. I beat my brother to it. That&#39;s all that matters. One step closer to a full license.</p>

<p>If you do it, pay more attention to the indicators.</p>
