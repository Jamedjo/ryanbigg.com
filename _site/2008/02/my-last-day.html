            <p>It&#39;s been a while, but two Fridays ago was my last day working for SeaLink, well, for this contract anyway. You never know if I might get a new contract with them further down the road and I would love to come back and work with those amazing people.</p>

<p>I completed their online bookings &quot;module&quot; for their site as the last thing I did before I left, and it seemed they really appreciate it. I even got a better card than what Coles gave me, this one was actually bought from a shop instead of written hastily on receipt paper.  Written in it was:
<blockquote>&quot;Dear Ryan,
Thank you for all your help &amp; friendship and best of luck with the next exciting chapter of your life. Keep in touch &amp; we all look forward to hear from you.
All the best
Ali.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Ryan,
It was good working with you at your blistering  pace :) Have fun, and I&#39;ll see you at next Ruby meetup.
Anuj.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Ryan,
It has been a pleasure working with you. Thank you for your hard work &amp; best wishes for the future.
Michael&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Ryan,
It was great to work with you. hope you do great things in future... Good luck with your next assignment!  Have fun!!! Keep in touch.
Vish&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Ryan
Best of Luck.
Who will Elise and I argue with no? Keep in touch to let us know what&#39;s next.
Ems (Emma)&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Ryan,
Wishing you all the very best with your next adventure! It was lovely to work with you. Now put your shoes back on!
Elise&quot;</blockquote>
I look forward to catching up with these guys again in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>P.S. The shoes reference is I used to take my shoes off when it got really hot as I feel I work better without wearing sweaty shoes. I also used to walk 2km to work every day.
