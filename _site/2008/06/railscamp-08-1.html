        <small>28 Jun 2008</small><br>
        <p>I had an enjoyable weekend last weekend at Railscamp, and I had this whole 3-page summary written up for you readers but I&#39;d figured I&#39;d spare you that lengthy document (for now, ahahaha) . These are the things you need to know:</p>

<ol>
<li>It was held at Kariong (I kept calling it Kai-rong), about 6km from Gosford which itself is 1 hour and 30 minutes by train from Sydney. Scenic country-side, yada yada.</li>
<li>I am in love with Sydney trains. Flippable seats and no noisy engines.</li>
<li>The venue (one main hall, one &quot;cafeteria&quot; hall and two separate-but-joined domitories) was exceptional. We ran everything off a number of power points that you could count on one hand.</li>
<li>The people were exceptional. The talks were exceptional. Nothing beat Pat Allen&#39;s talk (the very last one at Railscamp 2.0), and nothing will ever.</li>
<li>Yes Guitar Hero was played. Two <strong>and </strong>Three. Yes, I won. Yes, I&#39;m a sore winner.</li>
<li>I also coded. Gitjour became a little weekend project and it was fun working on that with Lachlan Hardy, Tim Lucas, Dr. Nic &amp; Others.</li>
<li>Other applications included the ever-awesome Duke (Upload, Vote, Boogie), Swore-DS, and Pete Yandell&#39;s proposal to create an application to track species in the wild.</li>
<li>Dr. Nic was obsessed with Cherry Pie. When he wasn&#39;t playing it on Guitar Hero 2, he was humming/singing it.</li>
<li>The beds were creaky. Earplugs were my saviour.</li>
<li>Lachie had a machine that made him sound like Darth Vader whilst he slept. Very chilling. Earplugs helped here too.</li>
<li>There was a waterfall. We walked behind it. Then we bashed through the bush to camp.</li>
<li>Risked life / possible broken bones to climb a large rock face. using nothing but what nature provided. All this whilst trying to stop my camera from bashing against it. Then walked back to &quot;camp&quot;, only come out 500m away at the office. Stupid GPS!</li>
<li>Went away feeling fantastic.</li>
</ol>

<p>There was talk of possibly another Railscamp by the end of the year, or another one this time next year. I&#39;m looking very much forward to it.</p>
