    <p>Been doing a little study on the trains, coded up a little rails application and out of curiosity I&#8217;m recording the stations, what time a train <strong>should</strong> get to a station and what time it does. Pretty simple really.</p>

<p>And <a href='http://pastie.org/210030'>here's the results so far.</a></p>

<p>If there&#8217;s anybody else out there that journeys on the trains, I&#8217;d be interested if you could collect data for me for whatever line you&#8217;re travelling on. You don&#8217;t have to have a laptop, all I need is the stations and the time it stopped at them and what train you&#8217;re on.</p>
