    <s>Friends and stalkers, instead of having a RadarLAN at my dad's house on the 14th, I will now be attending InLAN instead. For more information please visit http://www.inlan.net.au. I'll see you all there. Coincidentally, this is the same weekend before I go away for a weekend, so consider this my going away party.</s>
<p>RadarLAN is back on. Please see Change of Plans #2.</p>
