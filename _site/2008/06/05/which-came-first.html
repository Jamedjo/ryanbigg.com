    <p>Today a question was asked by the work experience kid that made me think what in Ruby gets called first, a local variable or a method. The answer can be explained by this short irb example (thanks to Yuji Yukoo, a work mate of mine):</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
irb(main):001:0> a = "b"
=> "b"
irb(main):002:0> def a
irb(main):003:1> "a"
irb(main):004:1> end
=> nil
irb(main):005:0> a
=> "b"
irb(main):006:0> a()
=> "a"
</pre>
<p>Firstly we define a local variable called a, and then a method called a, and then we type a and press enter, and the local variable is outputted rather than the method. Next we call a() which outputs &#8220;a&#8221;, the code defined within the method a. It&#8217;s just one of those interesting things of note.</p>
