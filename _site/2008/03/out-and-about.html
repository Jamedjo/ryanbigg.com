            <p>Wow, this is the <strong>9th day in a row </strong>above 35 degrees celcius here, apparently a record for the state. No relief until Monday <strong>next week at least</strong>. Keep those airconditioners going people! Maybe if we turn them up high enough we might just reverse global warming! <em>rolleyes</em></p>

<p>Last week I got a phone call from my Nanna&#39;s husband, Doug, a 70-something year-old who&#39;s semi-competent with computers. He wanted me to come over and take a look at his computer because his Internet Explorer kept hanging when he went to his church&#39;s website (Church of Latterday Saints). So I went over there.</p>

<p>His place is about 20 minutes away. This day just so happened to be one of the days where my car&#39;s air-conditioning was doing a fantastic job by <strong>not turning on at all</strong>. I wind my window down as far as it goes. (about 1/3rd, thanks to Mr. Daniel Thorpe) I arrive there and peel myself out of my seat, and step out onto the footpath. It was warm out here, but not as bad as what the car was. I knock on the door and Nanna answers it and lets me in. It&#39;s like the friggin&#39; Arctic. I couldn&#39;t spot the polar bears or penguins, and I might&#39;ve seen an igloo. (heat exhaustion, anyone?) There&#39;s Doug sitting in his computer chair, and he welcomes me in. He&#39;s not wearing a shirt. Not what you want to see. I  helped him through his problem and almost instantly suggested he try Mozilla Firefox and so he did. Importing his bookmarks was a cinch, and that&#39;s all he wanted. They bought me lunch and afterwards we talked for a bit, and I left.</p>

<p>That image will still haunt me. Doug, in shorts, no shirt. <em>shudder</em></p>
