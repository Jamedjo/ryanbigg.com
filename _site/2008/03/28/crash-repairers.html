    <p>On the 5th of January this year, Daniel Thorpe hit my car with his car. He backed into it from about 15m away, whilst backing out of a driveway. He didn&#8217;t bother turning the wheel because that&#8217;s just retarded. I covered what happened in my &#8221;<a href='http://frozenplague.net/2008/01/07/the-weekend-from-hell/'>Weekend From Hell</a>&#8221; post, a couple of days after the event.</p>

<p>Eventually, around Feburary, I started talking to the insurance company. This was in part due to Daniel and my identically superior abilities at procrastinating.</p>

<p>On the 26th of March, I finally managed to get it to a crash repairer after waiting for about 3 weeks after initial contact with the crash repairer, due to them being &#8220;busy&#8221;.</p>

<p>I rock up with my car at 10am and they&#8217;re all sitting outside having a smoko. I leave them my car, and they say it will take them 2 days, and off I walked all the way back home (catching a train in between Salisbury and Elizabeth).</p>

<p>Today I phone them up asking when my car will be ready, to which they reply <strong>any time between 4:30 and 5pm</strong>. I accept this, and find out what train I can catch to get there around 5ish, giving them a little bit of lee-way so I&#8217;m not waiting around too long.</p>

<p>I shouldn&#8217;t have expected it to be done when I got there.</p>

<p>It was almost deja vu, the whole crew sitting outside on yet another smoko. <strong>I was there at 5pm. </strong>I walk inside expecting to see a receptionist, only to buzz and have her come in from the door where next to they were having their smoko. &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re here for the VL? Won&#8217;t be too much longer.</p>

<p>So I wait.</p>

<p>And wait.</p>

<p>And wait.</p>

<p>At <strong>6pm </strong>I am starting to get moderately pissed off. It shouldn&#8217;t take <strong>two days </strong>to fit a new door, which they didn&#8217;t do.</p>

<p>At <strong>6:15pm</strong> I am getting more and more pissed off. Tapping my feet, rubbing my face&#8230; ugh.</p>

<p>At <strong>6:30pm</strong> I make it my mission to walk out at <strong>6:45</strong> without telling them, leaving to get dinner and hopefully returning when it&#8217;s done.</p>

<p>At <strong>6:40pm </strong>My car is finally ready. I get in it and try out things. The first thing I tried was the door handle, which was still the original door handle. They had only replaced the outer shell of the door, not the entire door like I thought they would. The handle is probably still going to be dicky, and if it fucks up I&#8217;m going to raise Hell.</p>

<p>Then I wound down the window, which worked. Then I got in and tried adjusting the mirror only to find the control on the inside was still unresponsive as before hand. This was another thing that wasn&#8217;t fixed.</p>

<p>This is sub-par service from an &#8220;approved repairer&#8221;.<strong> No customer should have to wait an hour and forty minutes without any kind of compensation, offer of food/drink or mention of how long it's going to take.</strong> I would ask the RAA to take away their status as an approved repairer, but I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s more of the insurance company&#8217;s fault for not doing a proper inspection of the car, like they should have. I&#8217;m pretty sure I mentioned to them about the handle and the mirror, but nothing was done.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m going to have to wait until Monday before I hear anything more about my mirror and handle. I don&#8217;t want to pay anything, I shouldn&#8217;t have to pay anything. They should&#8217;ve done the job properly the first time.</p>

<p>Never trust crash repairers. Always get THEM to call YOU when it&#8217;s done, don&#8217;t ask them when it&#8217;ll be ready because whatever they say will be <strong>false</strong>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be back later, building my mini-nuke &#8220;in case of emergency&#8221;</p>
