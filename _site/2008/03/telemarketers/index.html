        <p>I was joking on Eyerc yesterday that we haven&#8217;t yet had a power outage, and at dad&#8217;s house last night just after he finished cooking dinner, the power went out. gg etsa.</p>

<p>I went over Dad&#8217;s for dinner last night and he was telling me he was sick of getting calls from telemarketers. We joked about what we should do when these idiots call up. I bragged about never receiving a single call from a telemarketer since I moved into mum&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>That changed this morning.</p>

<p>Apparently I&#8217;d won a free trip to Florida! So I pressed &#8220;9&#8221; for more information and waited. This is the worst part, where they call you and then put you on hold. It&#8217;s a pathetic tactic. I waited some more, and eventually some guy with either a very good or a very bad (depending which way you look at it) american accent came on the line. He greeted me, and I greeted him back with the line: &#8220;Never call this number again. Take it off your list. Call it again and I will hunt you down.&#8221; I don&#8217;t exactly view these people as human, so I hung up.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s your stories for telemarketers? I want comments!</p>
