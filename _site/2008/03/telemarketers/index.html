        <p>I was joking on Eyerc yesterday that we haven&#39;t yet had a power outage, and at dad&#39;s house last night just after he finished cooking dinner, the power went out. gg etsa.</p>

<p>I went over Dad&#39;s for dinner last night and he was telling me he was sick of getting calls from telemarketers. We joked about what we should do when these idiots call up.  I bragged about never receiving a single call from a telemarketer since I moved into mum&#39;s house.</p>

<p>That changed this morning.</p>

<p>Apparently I&#39;d won a free trip to Florida! So I pressed &quot;9&quot; for more information and waited. This is the worst part, where they call you and then put you on hold. It&#39;s a pathetic tactic. I waited some more, and eventually some guy with either a very good or a very bad (depending which way you look at it) american accent came on the line. He greeted me, and I greeted him back with the line: &quot;Never call this number again. Take it off your list. Call it again and I will hunt you down.&quot; I don&#39;t exactly view these people as human, so I hung up.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s your stories for telemarketers? I want comments!</p>
