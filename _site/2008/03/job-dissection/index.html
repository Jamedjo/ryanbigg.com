<p>www: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.techjobslosangeles.com/'>http://www.techjobslosangeles.com</a> LinkedIn: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinjenkins'>http://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinjenkins</a>&lt;/blockquote&gt; The title for it was &#8220;World Famous Cutting Edge Company&#8221;, and it&#8217;s another advertisement where they just so happen to forget to name this &#8220;World Famous Cutting Edge Company&#8221;!</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s move right on to the person who, if we got this job, we would be reporting to: &#8220;Director of Web, Creative, and Technology&#8221;. What&#8217;s that saying? The longer the title the smaller the intelligence? Something like that. I&#8217;ve never met the guy (or girl), so I can&#8217;t pass judgement. It&#8217;s just a long title; &#8220;Lead Developer&#8221; is fine, really.</p>

<p>It moves on to say that you should be able to build &#8220;prototypes&#8221; and &#8220;wireframes&#8221;, which could mean anything, for example: elaborate real-life models of how all your tables interconnect, kind of like people doing degrees in Science have the models of molecules and so on.</p>

<p>The first two points in the qualifications are fine, &#8220;knowledge of unix development&#8221; (pay attention to this first one) and &#8220;ability to write clean code&#8221;, but the third gets a little funky: <blockquote>Familiar with Apache, SSH, SVN and CVS</blockquote> Why the need to have familiarity with SVN <strong>and</strong> CVS? Surely all the projects would be kept on one (SVN, I hope) rather than the other.</p>

<p>It continues on listing the obviously needed skills, such as experience in Ruby on Rails (why would you advertise on rubyonrails-talk if you were looking for a Cobol developer?) It uses a whole string of long words in order to make the qualifications more than what they seem, but in reality all you&#8217;ll need is some decent understanding of Ruby on Rails, MySQL and Apache, and lets not forget the obvious Three Big Ones, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>It mentions in there also about being aware of accessibility issues, which is fine if you&#8217;re going to have people with a disability accessing your site, which I&#8217;m assuming they&#8217;re going to do. Just, don&#8217;t go over the top with this. I once saw a site which had a small video of a woman translating the page&#8217;s text into sign language.</p>

<p>Now remember before how I said to pay attention to the fact that they said &#8220;knowledge of unix development&#8221;? Well in this next set of text &#8220;Plus Factors&#8221;, it says &#8220;experience with TextMate, Transmit&#8221; both of which are Mac programs. Mac is part-Unix as well, but that wasn&#8217;t stated in the initial briefing that development would be being done on Macs, and I feel that would&#8217;ve been handy to point out from the offset, not that developing on Macs is at all a bad idea. TextMate apparently kicks the ass of anything else out there, I&#8217;m yet to try it.</p>

<p>It still bugs me that they didn&#8217;t name the company, although I can guess out of the very limited number of &#8220;World Famous Cutting Edge&#8221; companies around, that it might be&#8230;</p>
