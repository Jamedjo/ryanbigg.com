        <p>After finishing my contract with SeaLink on the 25th January, I took a two week break from doing anything Ruby on Rails and then jumped straight back into it. I&#39;ve recently tied up my loose end with JustComputing and they&#39;re happy enough that I&#39;m done with their system that they gave me 4 x 500GB harddrives. I&#39;m now doing some contract work for SA Window Cleaning and I&#39;m hoping that I&#39;ll be done in about a month. After that, Dad wants me to do a job for him for his work (photocopier company) and I&#39;ve still got offers from NetFox and CarbonPlanet, as well as Lama Chandrasena.</p>

<p>I appreciate everyone&#39;s interest in wanting me to do work for them, but unfortunately I&#39;m tied down for the next couple of months at least, which is a good thing. I&#39;d love to work for NetFox, as that was the first thing to gain my interest when I went to the first Ruby Users group back in May last year, but I wanted a break from anything networking (after doing a couple of years of it at TAFE), so I went for SeaLink and that was a blast!</p>

<p>NetFox still has me interested and I&#39;ll probably go for that after these couple of other jobs are done.</p>

<p>Thanks again to the people who have asked me if I want to work for them. I hope to talk with you all at the Ruby Users Group meeting next Tuesday!</p>
