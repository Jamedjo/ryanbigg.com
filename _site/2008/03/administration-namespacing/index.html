        <a href="/2008/03/administration-namespacing"><header>Administration Namespacing</header></a>
        <p>A while after completing work at SeaLink, Tom asked me about my forum hobby project and why it wasn&#8217;t working. This led to me working on it for a few days and getting it all up to scratch again, and this involved moving it over to Rails 2.0 (that&#8217;s how long I hadn&#8217;t worked on it for), and using the awesomeness that is namespacing.</p>

<p>Namespacing is where you have some controllers in a separate area of your site. In my example, I have an admin folder in <span class='term'>app/controllers</span> which contains all the controllers for the administration section of my site, and all the relevant actions. Just inside the <span class='term'>app/controllers</span> directory, I have the other controllers which do all the basic stuff such as showing forums, basically anything a standard user can do.</p>

<p>It seems to be a fairly common question asked in places, so I figured if I sat down and wrote this, I would have something to send to people, much like my <a href='http://frozenplague.net/2008/01/06/restful-routing-an-overview/'>Restful Routes tutorial</a>, which ideally should&#8217;ve covered namespacing too.</p>

<p>First of all we&#8217;re going to create our namespace. To do that, we open up <span class='term'>config/routes.rb</span> and specify our namespace: <pre lang='rails'>map.namespace(:admin) do |admin|
admin.resources :forums, :topics, :posts
end</pre> Now what this does is defines some routes for us. If you&#8217;ve seen <span class='term'>map.resources</span> you&#8217;ll know that this defines routes for us, for example doing map.resources :forums will define methods such as <span class='term'>forums_path</span> which is the same as <span class='term'>{ :controller => "forums", :action => "index" }</span> and <span class='term'>forum_path(@forum) </span>which is the same as <span class='term'>{ :controller => "forums", :action => "show", :id => @forum.id }</span>. These methods really are lifesavers and save you a hell of a lot of typing. The routes defined by this namespace method however are prefixed with whatever argument you pass it, in this case we&#8217;ve passed it <span class='term'>:admin</span> so it&#8217;s going to give us routes like <span class='term'>admin_forums_path</span>, which is the same as <span class='term'>{ :controller = > "admin/forums", :action => "index" }, </span>and as you can see again saves us a lot of typing.</p>

<p>Now that we have our namespace, we can create our subfolders. These subfolders are placed in <span class='term'>app/controllers </span>and <span class='term'>app/views </span>and are given the same name as the namespace, admin. So go ahead and do that now. In <span class='term'>app/controllers/admin </span>is where we place our controllers. As an example, here&#8217;s what my forums controller&#8217;s edit and update actions look like: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class Admin::ForumsController </pre></p>

<p>def update @forum = Forum.find(params<span>:id</span>) if @forum.update_attributes(params<span>:forum</span>) flash<span>:notice</span> = &#8220;Forum has been updated.&#8221; redirect else flash<span>:notice</span> = &#8220;Forum has not been updated.&#8221; render :action =&gt; &#8220;edit&#8221; end end end&lt;/pre&gt; What I really want to show you in here is only the first line the class is defined as Admin::ForumsController, which shows that we&#8217;re namespacing it. We don&#8217;t have to define the Admin prefix anywhere. What we do have to define however is our non-existant Admin::ApplicationController. In my code, I&#8217;ve defined my own Admin::ApplicationController as a means of calling methods that should be called before all admin actions, such as my <span class='term'>non_admin_redirect</span> method, which is defined in <span class='term'>lib/authenticated_system.rb</span> and goes something like this: <pre lang='rails'>  def non_admin_redirect
    if !is_admin?
      flash[:notice] = "You need to be an admin to do that."
      redirect_back_or_default(:controller => "/accounts", :action => "login")
    end
  end</pre> To define your <span class='term'>Admin::ApplicationController</span>, make a file in <span class='term'>app/controllers/admin</span> called <span class='term'>application_controller.rb</span>. Even though the main application controller is defined as <span class='term'>application.rb</span> in <span class='term'>app/controllers</span>, that file is automatically loaded by Rails. If we named our application_controller to just application.rb, it would not be automatically loaded because Rails only looks for application.rb and files ending in <em>controller.rb in the app/controllers directory, so we name ours application</em>controller.rb so it plays nice with Rails.</p>

<p>In here we define our class, layout and helper: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class Admin::ApplicationController </pre></p>

<p>The before_filter is triggered before every action in the admin controller to make sure it&#8217;s an admin doing the action rather than a standard user.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s all there is to it, really. It&#8217;s all pretty simple. Now all you&#8217;ve gotta do is generate your views. Remember to place them in app/views/admin/the_controller&#8217;s_name, otherwise you&#8217;ll run into problems.</p>

<p>It seems I forgot to mention how it&#8217;s supposed to work when you&#8217;re calling the method to go to the namespaced path, well that&#8217;s simple. If you have a forum you would like to edit, the correct method is <span class='term'>edit_admin_forum_path(forum_object)</span>, because you want to edit, in the namespace of admin, a certain forum. For paths not requiring a prefix, such as the show and index actions, they are <span class='term'>admin_forum_path(forum_object)</span> and admin_forums_path respectively.</p>

<p>For an action such as an update action, it would be <span class='term'>admin_forum_path(forum_object)</span> with a <span class='term'>:method => :put</span> option specified in whatever you&#8217;re using. Usually you won&#8217;t have to do this, because the form_for helper would do it for you, but in some cases you might have to.</p>
