The title for it was &quot;World Famous Cutting Edge Company&quot;, and it&#39;s another advertisement where they just so happen to forget to name this &quot;World Famous Cutting Edge Company&quot;!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s move right on to the person who, if we got this job, we would be reporting to: &quot;Director of Web, Creative, and Technology&quot;. What&#39;s that saying? The longer the title the smaller the intelligence? Something like that. I&#39;ve never met the guy (or girl), so I can&#39;t pass judgement. It&#39;s just a long title; &quot;Lead Developer&quot; is fine, really.</p>

<p>It moves on to say that you should be able to build &quot;prototypes&quot; and &quot;wireframes&quot;, which could mean anything, for example: elaborate real-life models of how all your tables interconnect, kind of like people doing degrees in Science have the models of molecules and so on.</p>

<p>The first two points in the qualifications are fine, &quot;knowledge of unix development&quot; (pay attention to this first one) and &quot;ability to write clean code&quot;, but the third gets a little funky:
<blockquote>Familiar with Apache, SSH, SVN and CVS</blockquote>
Why the need to have familiarity with SVN <strong>and</strong> CVS? Surely all the projects would be kept on one (SVN, I hope) rather than the other.</p>

<p>It continues on listing the obviously needed skills, such as experience in Ruby on Rails (why would you advertise on rubyonrails-talk if you were looking for a Cobol developer?) It uses a whole string of long words in order to make the qualifications more than what they seem, but in reality all you&#39;ll need is some decent understanding of Ruby on Rails, MySQL and Apache, and lets not forget the obvious Three Big Ones, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>It mentions in there also about being aware of accessibility issues, which is fine if you&#39;re going to have people with a disability accessing your site, which I&#39;m assuming they&#39;re going to do. Just, don&#39;t go over the top with this. I once saw a site which had a small video of a woman translating the page&#39;s text into sign language.</p>

<p>Now remember before how I said to pay attention to the fact that they said &quot;knowledge of unix development&quot;? Well in this next set of text &quot;Plus Factors&quot;, it says &quot;experience with TextMate, Transmit&quot; both of which are Mac programs. Mac is part-Unix as well, but that wasn&#39;t stated in the initial briefing that development would be being done on Macs, and I feel that would&#39;ve been handy to point out from the offset, not that developing on Macs is at all a bad idea. TextMate apparently kicks the ass of anything else out there, I&#39;m yet to try it.</p>

<p>It still bugs me that they didn&#39;t name the company, although I can guess out of the very limited number of &quot;World Famous Cutting Edge&quot; companies around, that it might be...</p>
