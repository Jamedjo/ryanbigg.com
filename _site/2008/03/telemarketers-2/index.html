        <a href="/2008/03/telemarketers-2"><header>Telemarketers: The Government Entity</header></a>
        <p>Not so long ago I wrote a post about <a href='http://frozenplague.net/2008/03/14/telemarketers/'>receiving a call from a telemarketer</a> after bragging about never being called by one the day before.</p>

<p>Today I received my second call from a telemarketer, this time from a different mob. This time my number had been &#8220;randomly selected&#8221; and I was entitled to a whole heap of gift cards from various retailers. After listening to his spiel (whilst typing &#8220;LOL TELEMARKETER&#8221; in chat) I asked him where he got the number from. He gave back a vague reply of &#8220;our database&#8221;, and I informed him that my number is a top-secret government number and any company calling it can face a fine of up to $250,000. I asked if he knew about that law and he replied he didn&#8217;t. I kindly asked him not to call the number again else his company will be fined, and to take the number off his database.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right away, sir! God bless. Bye!&#8221; he said hurriedly.</p>
