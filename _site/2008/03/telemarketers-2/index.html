        <p>Not so long ago I wrote a post about <a href="http://frozenplague.net/2008/03/14/telemarketers/">receiving a call from a telemarketer</a> after bragging about never being called by one the day before.</p>

<p>Today I received my second call from a telemarketer, this time from a different mob. This time my number had been &quot;randomly selected&quot; and I was entitled to a whole heap of gift cards from various retailers.  After listening to his spiel (whilst typing &quot;LOL TELEMARKETER&quot; in chat) I asked him where he got the number from. He gave back a vague reply of &quot;our database&quot;, and I informed him that my number is a top-secret government number and any company calling it can face a fine of up to $250,000. I asked if he knew about that law and he replied he didn&#39;t. I kindly asked him not to call the number again else his company will be fined, and to take the number off his database.</p>

<p>&quot;Right away, sir! God bless. Bye!&quot; he said hurriedly.</p>
