    <p>The site <a href='http://twonklist.com'>twonklist.com</a> was an idea conceived of at my last job (NetFox) and I coded it up in a night or two with Brenton Fletcher adding the styling in later on.</p>

<p>This afternoon it was defaced. I have since removed all the awesome pictures a certain person put on the site, and it&#8217;s a person who apparently has a grudge against me. Now, I know who this person is. I even know their IP is 122.109.249.211. I know their ISP is Optus. I&#8217;ve even sent an email (with screenshots!) in the vain hope that they&#8217;ll do something about it, but they most likely will not. Now if you have a grudge against me, the way to go about things is to not deface any of my sites. You come to me, face to face, as a man and talk to me. I&#8217;m available most days. Say what you like, just don&#8217;t deface my sites.</p>

<p>Congratulations to this person, as now all the requests from any IP beginning with 122.109 will <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=how+not+to+be+a+fucktard'>go to a very useful/useless google search entry</a>. Yes, that basically means the entire Optus network.</p>
