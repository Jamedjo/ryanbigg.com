	<li><strong>Have you tried stopping your server and starting it? This fixes many problems and may fix yours!</strong></li>
	<li>If you're getting a NoMethodError which ends in "The error occured when evaluating nil.method" this means you're trying to call a method on a nil object! Check the object that you're calling that method on and make sure that it actually is set!</li>
	<li><strong>Google the error message. </strong>If you're getting "undefined method `blah`", try googling just "undefined method". Never ask a question without googling first.</li>
	<li>State your problem clearly. Never, ever say "I have a problem plzzzz help me !!!1!" or " is not working" or something to that effect. Say, for example, that you're getting an undefined method. Type "pastie: hi" into the channel and the pastie bot will send you a link via private message where you<strong> can show us your code, stack trace and error. Giving all three will provide us 99% of the time with the information we need to help you solve your problem.
</strong></li>
	<li>Don't use dummy examples. An example would be asking a question like "How does A relate to B?" when asking "How does a blog relate to comment?".</li>
	<li>Don't ask "can you do &lt;thing&gt; with Rails?", because the most often answer is "Yes". Ask rather "How can you do &lt;thing&gt; with Rails?"</li>
	<li>Don't ask to ask, just ask.</li>
	<li>Paste anything over 3 lines of code using the pastie service (type "pastie: hello") into the channel and the pastie bot will send you a link via private message where you can put your code.</li>
	<li>Don't ask "Has anybody used &lt;thing&gt;?" rather state your problem that you're having with &lt;thing&gt; and somebody may be able to help you. See #2.</li>
	<li>Don't prefix your question with a statement or another question. For example just write your problem rather than prefixing it with something like "Can anyone help me with this? &lt;problem&gt;" or "I am a noob help me with &lt;problem&gt;" or "I have a problem... &lt;problem&gt;" it's a waste of your time typing it out and a waste of our time reading it.</li>
	<li>Computers never lie.</li>
	<li>Don't ask subjective questions. "Subjective" means a question that's answer is entirely opinion based, such as questions like "What is the best text editor?" or "What is the best testing framework?"</li>
