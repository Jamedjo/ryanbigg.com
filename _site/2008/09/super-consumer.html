        <small>30 Sep 2008</small><br>
        <p>So I have this friend who&#39;s the same age as me. He doesn&#39;t work. He doesn&#39;t appear to be actively looking for work. He got &quot;fired&quot; from his last job because he wasn&#39;t fast enough, but apparently the boss was an asshole. There was an excuse for the job before it too, but I can&#39;t remember what that was. He&#39;s constantly getting new things. I&#39;d like to refer to him as a &quot;super-consumer&quot;, someone who has too much. He loves NERF and Transformers (keeping in mind he&#39;s the same age as me). He&#39;s never outwardly happy with the things he has, and is constantly in a &quot;covet thy neighbour&quot; state of mind (and he&#39;s Christian!), always wanting the next level up as soon as it&#39;s been released. Take for instance the graphics card I won at AsLAN in a silent auction. He asked me if <b>I</b> could put <b>my</b> brand new graphics card into <b>his</b> media center. His argument was for when he has movie nights, then I will appreciate the gift I gave unto him. Admittedly, it&#39;s a card I have no use for, at the moment, but it&#39;s always handy to have a spare in case things go wrong. So, rather than him actually putting the energy used into his craving for all that is new &amp; shiny into finding work so that he can buy all that is new &amp; shiny, he just craves. I think this path is going to destroy him, and there&#39;s nothing I can do or say that will open his eyes to what he is bringing on himself. </p>
