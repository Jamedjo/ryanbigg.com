    <p>With many, many thanks to Frederick Cheung, who without this would&#8217;ve been way more painful and time-consuming. My original question and our discussion can be found <a href='http://groups.google.ca/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/49616be220fb8d1d'>here</a>.</p>

<p>At my new job we signed up with <a href='http://zendesk.com'>ZenDesk</a>, which acts as our helpdesk/ticketing system for our clients who sign up to our site and buy our product. Because ZenDesk uses emails instead of plain ol&#8217; usernames for authentication, Ruby chucked a fit when we tried doing stuff like: <pre lang='rails'>class User &lt; ActiveResource::Base
self.site = "http://ouremail@ourwebsite.com:ourpassword@ourplace.zendesk.com"
end</pre> Ruby&#8217;s URI class just didn&#8217;t like that first @ sign in there! So Fred originally recommended we try to encode it, %40. That didn&#8217;t work. Then the next morning Fred suggests doing this: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class User &amp;lt; ActiveResource::Base
self.site = &quot;http://ourplace.zendesk.com&quot;</pre></p>

<p>def (self.site).user &#8220;ouremail@ourwebsite.com&#8221; end</p>

<p>def (self.site).password &#8220;ourpassword&#8221; end</p>

<p>end&lt;/pre&gt; And &#8216;lo and behold the thing worked!</p>

<p>So for all you savvy kids using Rails&#8217; ActiveResource and trying to make it play nice with ZenDesk, that&#8217;s how we did it.</p>

<p>Then I went a little further with the refactoring and just made a ZenDesk model: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class ZenDesk &amp;lt; ActiveResource::Base</pre></p>

<p>self.site = &#8220;http://ourplace.zendesk.com&#8221;</p>

<p>def (self.site).user &#8220;ouremail@ourwebsite.com&#8221; end</p>

<p>def (self.site).password &#8220;ourpassword&#8221; end</p>

<p>end end&lt;/pre&gt; And then got the models I wanted to inherit from that. <pre lang='rails'>class User &lt; ZenDesk
end</pre> Brilliant!</p>

<p>Also one more note. If you&#8217;re going through and testing out creating Organisations/Users in ZenDesk through ActiveResource, don&#8217;t forget to delete them as you go! It&#8217;s time-consuming clicking edit, and then the delete button for 50 odd objects&#8230; but of course you could do this: <pre lang='ruby'>for i in original_object_id..last_object_id
User.find(i).destroy
end</pre> Which, if you did it, say, all in the same day like I did, should delete all the users within that range.</p>
