    <p>Hilary Clinton.</p>

<p>The only <a href='http://www.news.com.au/common/imagedata/0,,5806861,00.jpg'>woman</a> candidate in the 2008 United States &#8220;Let&#8217;s-See-How-Long-We-Can-Drag-This-Out-For&#8221; Presidential campaign.</p>

<p>It surely is skillful to <a href='http://www.danzfamily.com/archives/blogphotos/07/hillary-clinton-faces-vertical.jpg'>have as many facial expression as Ms. Clinton</a>, but how is that going to help the American economy? We all know how bad women are with spending. Would you give one woman the control over an entire country&#8217;s wallet? I wouldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s just hope if she&#8217;s elected she won&#8217;t decompose into <a href='http://www.news.com.au/common/imagedata/0,,5806861,00.jpg'>Yet Another Old Person</a> unlike a certain <a href='http://www.registers1.com/mccain/images/mccain.jpg'>other candidate</a>.</p>
