            <p>Today I was going to put on my music, but I&#39;ve listened to all the good stuff in there over and over again. I was thinking of putting on Finger Eleven&#39;s Paralyzer as it&#39;s a catchy song, so I started humming the chorus as I turned to my radio to turn it on.</p>

<p>Not only was it that song on Nova, but it was around a second past where I was just humming it. Freaky.</p>

<p>Also a few years ago, at a family gathering and after Grandad had passed away, the conversation changed topic to his girlfiend, Shirley. No one had heard from her for at least a year, and a few people said they&#39;d seen her in the shops. During this conversation, Aunty Eileen gets a call on her mobile and we joke &quot;Oh that&#39;ll be Shirley&quot;. Surely enough, Aunty Eileen goes &quot;Oh, hi Shirley&quot;, loud enough for the room to hear over the conversation.</p>

<p>Anyone else had something like this?</p>
