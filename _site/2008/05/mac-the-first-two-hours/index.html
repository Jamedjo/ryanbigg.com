        <p>So today as a kind of a reward for working hard and kind of I&#8217;ve always wanted one, I bought myself a MacBook Pro. It&#8217;s a 15.4&#8221;, 2.4ghz, yada yada, brand new MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>I took the train in to town (after being placed on hold for 10 minutes) and, thanks to Google Maps&#8217;s wonderful position of Next Byte (saying it was on the southern side of Rundle Mall when it was actually on the northern side), I accidentally stumbled into the store whilst looking for it. The guy who served me was more than happy to go upstairs and get one&#8230; but when he returned the serial number didn&#8217;t match. So he went to get another&#8230; and the serial number still didn&#8217;t match! Each time taking about 3 minutes. Third time lucky, he came back and said &#8220;I know this is in the system&#8221;, and I bought it on the spot. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s now two hours after I&#8217;ve gotten home. It was weird at first having a perfectly good computer in front of me and not knowing what to do with it, but once you play around with it for a little while things (simple and not so simple) become obvious. The dock is probably my favourite feature so far, even if I did have to make it about 33% of it&#8217;s original size. I&#8217;ve also managed to install Git!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The downloads box is another good feature, but it needs some more notification, like what the Colloquy window has when someone says your name. I love the way you install programs, so non-fuss. I click once on the downloaded file and it&#8217;s already there for me to use.</p>

<p>If the ambient light is bright enough, the keyboard keys are not illuminated and the screen gets brighter automatically so you can see in lighter conditions. There is a certain limit to how dark the screen gets, so you&#8217;re not going to be adjusting the brightness if you&#8217;re sitting in a dark cave somewhere.</p>

<p>The magnetic power plug is good too, and I know full well the damage that can be caused to a laptop when you trip over a cord that&#8217;s plugged into one; I recently destroyed the headphone socket when I tripped over the cord coming out of my Toshiba laptop. I know that if I trip over the Mac&#8217;s power cord, it should come out right away. The annoying thing I find about it is the light&#8230; but I guess I&#8217;ll get used to that.</p>

<p>The terminal was originally hard to find (I am/was/will be a Mac Noob), but eventually I did. I love how the commands are so unix like, such as sudo to do stuff as root and&#8230; just about any unix command you can think of.</p>

<p>Another nice touch is having the menu bar at the very top of the screen rather than the application, so whatever application you&#8217;re in it&#8217;s always in the same spot and generally the menus seem to be laid out the same way.</p>

<p>One last thing, <em>everything</em> looks so god damned shiny. It&#8217;s awesome. The fonts are all anti-aliased (except the terminal&#8217;s by default, not too hard to change) and the buttons all have that classic Mac styling we&#8217;ve come to love and envy.</p>

<p>All in all, a very nice system and worth the money.</p>
