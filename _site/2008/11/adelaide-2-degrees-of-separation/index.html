        <p>One thing that apparently struck a lot of people when they came to Adelaide for Railscamp last weekend was how small Adelaide actually is. Over the course of a few months there&#8217;s been a few instances where I&#8217;ve known people I&#8217;ve spoken with through a very small degree of separation. The three instances that I&#8217;ve encountered this year are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The guy I hit with my car has a friend who's dad works with my dad</li>
  <li>Yesterday had a barbecue @ James's house and met up with somebody who uses the Netfox product</li>
  <li>At the barbecue also met up with a girl who hangs out with an old childhood friend of mine who I haven't seen in years</li>
</ul>
<p>It amazes me how we&#8217;re all interconnected somehow.</p>
