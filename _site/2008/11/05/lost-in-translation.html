    <p>On my pet project rBoard I&#8217;ve been adding in <span class='term'>t</span> calls every where just in case someone wants to use it and translate it into their own language, and I got petrified of missing a translation somewhere along the lines so tonight (with a little help from #rubyonrails) I made a little rake task to check for you: <script src='http://gist.github.com/27686.js' /></p>

<p>Stick this in a file in <em>lib/tasks</em> and run it by typing <span class='term'>rake missing_translations</span> and you&#8217;ll be told what&#8217;s missing from what file and from what locale and you&#8217;ll even be given a nice counter that you can watch slowly decrement every time you fix a missing translation!</p>
