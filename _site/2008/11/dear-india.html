        <small>05 Nov 2008</small><br>
        <p>I grow weary of you undercutting us honest workers in the web design industry and sending people who obviously do not know how to speak the English language into a primarily english based programming language. Perhaps, if you taught them how to speak the language the code is written in, then perhaps I would not be writing this blog post. I am not intending to be racist, but if it comes across that way I don&#39;t really care. I worked with two people from different regions of India for near-on 8 months and they were two of the smartest (and greatest) people I have ever met.</p>

<p>Your <s>slaves</s> workers come into #rubyonrails and ask in their distorted english extremely vague questions and expect us to help them with little or no clue as to what they&#39;re trying to do. Then when you ask them, it takes them forever to respond because they have to translate from their language, to ours. It is annoying and frankly I am no longer willing to put up with it. From now on anybody from India asking a question in #rubyonrails will be promptly placed on my ignore list unless they simply: 1) Ask in clear, concise English 2) Explain what their problem is rather than going &quot;can any1 hlp me plz????&quot;</p>

<p>What I am asking here is that before throwing them into the deep end of a programming language, teach them how to speak English (and not that shorthand crap either) and how to be polite and courteous and grateful for the <b>free</b> help we hand out on a daily basis in #rubyonrails. That&#39;s all, no strings attached. Simple.</p>

<p>Love,
Radar</p>
