    <p>This tutorial was written using Ruby 1.8.6, Rails 2.2.2 and Rubygems 1.3.1.</p>

<p>This question has been coming up a lot recently. People want urls like http://domain.com/frozenplague-rules-my-world but they don&#8217;t know how to do it.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a model called Blog and this is what you want to match to http://domain.com/frozenplague-rules-my-world. In this model you define:</p>
<b>app/models/blog.rb</b><pre lang='rails'>
def to_param
  "#{id}-#{title.parameterize}"
end
</pre>
<p>And then this in your config/routes.rb <pre lang='rails'>
map.connect ':slug', :controller => "blogs", :action => "show"
</pre></p>

<p>And now you should be able to access blogs through http://domain.com/frozenplague-rules-my-world.</p>
