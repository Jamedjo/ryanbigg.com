        <p>Yesterday I was given my two weeks notice by my boss, he cited personality issues. I had posts on this website explaining my side of the story and why I felt the way I did, but I have chosen to take them down on the advice that it may cost me future employment and that it also may land me in legal &#8220;hot water&#8221;. What can you say these days without getting in trouble?</p>

<p>I planned on riding Adelaide to Elizabeth again today. Had a meeting with the SeaLink guys about Railscamp #4 sponsorship instead and did four laps of lake torrens on my bike before the right pedal on my bike came loose.</p>

<p>Time to chill.</p>
