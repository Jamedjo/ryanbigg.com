        <small>30 Apr 2015</small><br>
        <p>There are a lot of people who wish to get started with Ruby and Rails, but
don&#39;t know where to start. I hope that this post will serve as a guide for
those people.</p>

<h2>Operating Systems</h2>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>People try to develop Ruby and Ruby on Rails apps on Windows and they struggle
with it. You can try developing on it, but know that it&#39;s going to be more
painful than the other options (Linux or Mac).</p>

<p>It&#39;s for this reason that I recommend installing Ubuntu in a VM
(using <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>) on your Windows PC if you&#39;re
in that environment.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu</h3>

<p>Once you&#39;ve got Ubuntu setup, you can follow my <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2014/10/ubuntu-ruby-ruby-install-chruby-and-you/">Ubuntu, Ruby, ruby-install,
chruby, Rails and You blog post</a>
which will setup a proper development environment for you on Ubuntu.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#39;t install Ruby packages from <code>apt</code></strong>. That way lies pain and suffering.</p>

<h3>Mac</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re on Mac, you can follow many of the same steps in the Ubuntu guide.
Install ruby-install, chruby as per that guide, and then you can install
<a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, and then install PostgreSQL by running this
command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">brew install postgresql
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or MySQL with this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">brew install mysql
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Getting started with Ruby</h2>

<h3>The Ruby Koans</h3>

<p><strong>FREE</strong></p>

<p>Your environment is now setup and now you&#39;re wondering where to go from here.
I <em>always</em> recommend the <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">Ruby Koans</a> which, as their
site says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn Ruby. The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and some common functions and libraries. We also teach you culture. Testing is not just something we pay lip service to, but something we live. It is essential in your quest to learn and do great things in the language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Koans are a fantastic introduction to Ruby and if I had my way, it&#39;d be
where all newbies started to learn. You don&#39;t have to complete them all, just
try your best. It&#39;s time I admitted: I&#39;ve never actually completed the Koans
myself. One day I might.</p>

<h3>The Well-Grounded Rubyist</h3>

<p><strong>NON-FREE</strong></p>

<p>If a book is more your style, then <a href="http://manning.com/black3">The Well-Grounded
Rubyist</a> is the one that I would recommend. The
very first version of this book (Ruby for Rails) is what I learned Ruby from.
I don&#39;t link to it here because it was out of date when I read it and that
makes it even more out of date now.</p>

<h3>Jumpstart Labs Tutorials</h3>

<p><strong>FREE</strong></p>

<p>I also recommend checking out the <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/">Jumpstart Labs
Tutorials</a>, which are written by the
people who run <a href="http://turing.io">Turing Academy</a>. These include tutorials
that will introduce you to Ruby in 100 minutes, as well as some Sinatra and
Rails tutorials so that you can wrap your head around applying Ruby to web development.</p>

<h2>Getting started with Rails</h2>

<h3>Rails 4 in Action</h3>

<p><strong>NON-FREE</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;d be remiss of me to not mention my own book, <a href="https://manning.com/bigg2">Rails 4 in
Action</a> in this section. In the book, we build a
ticket-tracking application from the ground up using Behaviour Driven
Development. Thousands of people have found it to be a great introduction to
Rails, and some people have even gotten Rails jobs after having read it.</p>

<h3>Rails Tutorial</h3>

<p><strong>FREE</strong></p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to shell out the money for my book (and why not?!), then the
free <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Rails Tutorial</a> is the next-best-thing.
In that tutorial, you build a Twitter-like application from scratch. </p>
