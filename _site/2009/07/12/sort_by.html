    <p>Fresh on the heels of yesterdays <a href='http://github.com/radar/can_touch_this'>can_touch_this</a> I&#8217;ve released another plugin today called <a href='http://github.com/radar/sort_by'>sort_by</a>. It provides you a way of sorting a table by user selected fields <strong>and it even paginates</strong> <em>ooh</em> <em>ahh</em> <em>pause for ego boost</em>. Inspired by hearing people talk about having to make stuff from scratch to do this I worked on it for about the last 3 hours. Tell me what you think!</p>
