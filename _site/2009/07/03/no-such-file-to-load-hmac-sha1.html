    <p>When you encounter the above error, it means you&#8217;re missing the <s>ruby-openid</s> ruby-hmac gem. I couldn&#8217;t find anything on google that clearly stated this, so I&#8217;m posting it here as a reminder for myself and others.</p>

<p>Thanks to the comments for clarifying the gem needed.</p>
