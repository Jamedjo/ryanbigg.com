            <p>I admit that the title would be cooler if this were &quot;1 year on&quot; but I couldn&#39;t wait. Sorry.</p>

<p>Back in January I <a href="http://frozenplague.net/2009/01/ruby-191-rubygems-rails/">wrote a post</a> about installing Ruby 1.9.1 on my Mac OS X box and the issues associated with it. The &quot;end goal&quot; was to get <a href='http://github.com/radar/rboard'>rboard</a> running on it under passenger. This was painful back in January! It&#39;s so much easier now!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there&#39;s still <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1627582/ruby-1-9-1-p234-passenger-2-2-5-rails-2-3-stable-closed-stream-on-post-request">this bug </a> which effects you if you&#39;re on Passenger and 1.9.1. There&#39;s a patch for one of the answers there and that&#39;ll get your application working, but I&#39;m of the belief that you <strong>should not ever</strong> have to patch a gem and especially the Ruby source.</p>

<p><strong>I want to know: Have you tried running your app on 1.9? Have you encountered any showstoppers?</strong></p>

<p>Quite a lot has changed since January and I&#39;ve decided instead of updating that post, I&#39;m going to go through the entire process again.  This is because I would like to show how far Ruby has come during the time since I have written and updated that post and that running your application on Ruby 1.9.1 isn&#39;t as much hassle as people make it out to be.</p>

<p>This time I will be installing it all on an Ubuntu box, since that&#39;s more than likely the location where you&#39;re going to be deploying your app&#39;s code to. I&#39;ll be using Ruby 1.9.1p243 and Rails 2.3.5.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&#39;t like long blog posts <a href="http://gist.github.com/249555">here&#39;s the script</a> if you want to install everything without reading through the cruft. Running this script or <span class='term'>bash -c &quot;`wget -O - frozenplague.net/boris`&quot;</span> on your server will install the bare-basics:</p>

<ul>
<li>git (latest version)</li>
<li>apache 2</li>
<li>mysql 5</li>
<li>ruby 1.9.1</li>
<li>rails (latest gem version)</li>
<li>passenger (latest gem version)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you&#39;ll be able to setup your Rails app. I can&#39;t do that for you, sorry. My scripting-fu is not that good.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://ben.hoskings.net/">Ben Hoskings </a> for the inspiration for this script.</p>

<h2>The Long Road</h2>

<p>To install Ruby 1.9.1 from source on a base Ubuntu system there&#39;s a couple of pre-requisites. Let&#39;s cover why they&#39;re required.</p>

<h3>build-essential</h3>

<p>Includes stuff that is, well, <strong>essential</strong> to building things, like Ruby and the other dependencies.</p>

<h3>libssl-dev</h3>

<p>Needed for when we go to install Passenger. If not installed you&#39;ll get <code>no such file to load -- openssl</code> because Ruby didn&#39;t install <em>openssl</em> because this dependency was not installed. Fun times were had.</p>

<h3>libreadline-dev</h3>

<p>Needed for launching script/console. It&#39;ll complain  <code>no such file to load -- readline</code> when trying to launch it. </p>

<h3>zlib</h3>

<p>When you go to <code>sudo gem install rails</code> you&#39;ll get <code>no such file to load -- zlib</code>. This error message is not helpful but it means you need zlib1g installed: <code>sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev</code></p>

<p>Now you&#39;ll be able to download and install ruby:</p>

<pre>
mkdir ruby
cd ruby
wget --progress=bar ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.1-p243.tar.gz -O - | tar -zxf - --strip-components 1
./configure
make
echo "Need your password to install Ruby:"
sudo make install
</pre>

<p>And then finally your gems:</p>

<pre>
cd ~
sudo rm -rf ruby
sudo gem install mysql passenger rails
sudo passenger-install-apache2-module
</pre>

<p>I needed to patch Ruby + Passenger with<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1627582/ruby-1-9-1-p234-passenger-2-2-5-rails-2-3-stable-closed-stream-on-post-request/1671305#1671305"> this patch</a>, as when I went to log in to rboard it gave me the error at the top of that page.</p>

<p>Other than that, all of this works <strong>perfectly fine</strong> on my bare-bones Ubuntu box. I was even able to get rboard running on this setup!</p>

<p>So again: Have you tried running your app on 1.9? Have you encountered any showstoppers? Really keen to hear your stories!</p>
