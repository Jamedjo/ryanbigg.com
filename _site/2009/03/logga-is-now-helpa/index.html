        <p>A few months ago I got in contact with Adam Thorsen who owns the http://loglibrary.com domain. He used to host the log files for the #rubyonrails channel on it, but stopped doing due to lack of time / whatever. So I wrote a bot over a couple of weekends and a parser (<a href="http://github.com/radar/logga-parser">later written in python</a>) for the logs from <a href='http://thesaq.com/rubyonrails'>radsaq&#39;s logs</a>. This was hosted through Adam&#39;s contacts at EngineYard. EngineYard&#39;s hosting was solid as and whenever there was an error they would contact us explaining what it was and how to fix it.</p>

<p>This all worked perfectly up until about a month ago when I started to receive &quot;threats&quot; that due to the global economic catastrophuck (<a href='http://elevensoft.com'>thanks to Andy Wright for that word</a>) I would have to start paying for the hosting on the EngineYard service. Also, the site I made for it wasn&#39;t receiving a high enough volume. I have too many side projects (rboard, lookup and Ruby 1.9 compatibility to name a few) that I need to get rid of some. This is one of them. If someone else would like to take over the logging and site part of &quot;logga&quot; I would be more than happy to hand this over. From today until further notice I will be hosting the bot in &quot;helpa&quot;-mode on my slicehost until someone else steps up. Thanks for your support for this project.</p>
