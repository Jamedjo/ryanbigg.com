    <p>This is the question I ask after I&#8217;ve just finished a massive debugging session and I run the tests and halfway through there&#8217;s something vague like &#8220;S3&#8221; printed out. So I do a Cmd+Shift+F looking for that string and of course it doesn&#8217;t exist. What&#8217;s a guy to do?</p>

<p>Well, at <a href='http://mocra.com'>Mocra</a> we put this in our <em>config/environment.rb</em> file (although a better location would be in a required file located somewhere in lib, probably named <em>debug.rb</em>): <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre&gt;
\# Print the location of puts/p calls so you can find them later
def puts str
  super caller.first if caller.first.index(&quot;shoulda.rb&quot;) == -1
  super str
end</pre></p>

<p>def p obj puts caller.first super obj end &lt;/pre&gt;</p>

<p>And when we don&#8217;t want it we comment it out. This will give us the exact location of the puts so we can track it down and remove it.</p>
