        <p>Today in #rubyonrails, <a href='http://kiwinewt.geek.nz/'>kiwinewt</a> asked:</p>
<blockquote>How can I have a model with a text field and have that text field in multiple languages?</blockquote>
<p>To which he meant that he has a model and he wants different versions of text displayed based on whatever the locale is set to. This is quite the common question in the channel and previously I&#8217;ve drawn blanks, but today I had a Moment of Clarity +10 and coded up something amazingly simple.</p>

<p>It has two parts. The first is the code in the model:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&apos;ruby&apos;&gt;
class Page &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  def self.with_locale(&amp;block)
    page = scoped_by_locale(I18n.locale.to_s) { block.call }.first
    page ||= scoped_by_locale(I18n.default_locale.to_s) { block.call }.first

    raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, &quot;The page you were looking for does not have a version in #{I18n.locale}&quot; if page.nil?
    
    page
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>And the second is how you use it:</p>
<pre>
  @page = Page.with_locale { Page.first }
</pre>
<p>Now if you set <span class='term'>I18n.locale</span> in your application and use <span class='term'>with_locale</span> it will automatically find records based on that locale.</p>
