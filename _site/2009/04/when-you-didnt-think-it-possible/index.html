<p>Ok. I&#8217;ll calm down now. Honestly guys, SoftMind even <a href='http://twitter.com/WebReservoir/status/1563836044'>talks to himself using an alternative twitter account</a> and prattles on about the most mundane shit ever. He surely cannot be your only source of news. He should never be anyone&#8217;s source of anything. Just ignore him and we can all pray together that he goes away (read: gets hit by a rapidly moving vehicle).</p>

<p>Please tell me you got the work experience kid to do this and he meant it as a joke, but you guys took it seriously.</p>

<p>Wow. Stunned.</p>
