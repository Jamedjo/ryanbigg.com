    <p>There are two things right now that I&#8217;m tired of hearing about one more fearful than the other. The first is this &#8220;Swine Flu&#8221; thing. With one of the guys doing work on the house next door coughing his lungs up I&#8217;m sure to close my windows &#8220;just in case&#8221; and leave extra-early.</p>

<p>The second is this whole porn presentation argument.</p>

<p>Guess which I fear more? Yeah, the porn presentation argument. I fear that it will rip a community apart. A community that should be working together on getting past this issue and bettering themselves, not regressing to childish bickering. That&#8217;s what gives this community an &#8220;immature&#8221; stamp by the <span>insert other programming language here</span> groups.</p>

<p>Matt &#8220;made a mistake&#8221; and <a href='http://merbist.com/2009/04/28/on-engendering-strong-reactions/'>he's "apologised"</a>. What&#8217;s been done cannot be undone and what we have to do as a community is work past this and rebuild whatever part of our reputation has been damaged by Matt&#8217;s actions and the subsequent bickering.</p>

<p>All I ask for you guys is to&#8230;</p>

<p>Chill.</p>
