        <p>We interrupt the slew of technical bloggings to bring you this announcement:</p>

<p>For the Radar fans out there living in Adelaide you&#8217;ll be glad to know that I&#8217;m coming back down (up?) <strong>there on Wednesday! </strong>That&#8217;s right, for a <strong>limited time only </strong>I shall return and hang out with as <strong>many of you as humanly possible</strong>. Just because I love you all.</p>

<p>On Wednesday I&#8217;ll be waking up at some ungodly hour, phoning a cab and then packing my crap. Then I&#8217;ll take the cab (and my crap) to the airport and I will then catch a flight out to Adelaide and arrive there at around 8:50am. From there on it&#8217;s fun &#38; festivities with family and friends! Cannot wait to see you all again! Be there!</p>
