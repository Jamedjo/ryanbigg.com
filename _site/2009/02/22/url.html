    <p>So today I learned me some <a href='http://sinatrarb.com'>Sinatra</a> after seeing <a href='http://twitter.com/drnic/status/1236303829'>drnic's tweet about a url generator for the mocra.com site</a>. I thought it couldn&#8217;t be that hard and it wasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>What I came up with was <a href='http://github.com/radar/url'>"url" (pronounced like "earl")</a>. You can host this on your site and provide people with urls that contain your site&#8217;s name. Enjoy.</p>

<p>This app is hosted at <a href='http://u.mocra.com'>http://u.mocra.com</a> now too, providing tinier URLs (by ~2 characters) than other services (only because we only have 17 URLs)!</p>
