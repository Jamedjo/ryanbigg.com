    <p>So I have this little hobby of mine called <a href='http://github.com/radar/rboard'>rBoard</a>. It&#8217;s gained some attention in recent times and I&#8217;m wondering what people want in this forum system that isn&#8217;t already implemented, or could be improved. Leave a comment and your feedback is appreciated.</p>
