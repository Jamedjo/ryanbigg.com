    <p>Today I spent an hour and a half writing a Sinatra app (and rocking out to Foo Fighters) for a problem that&#8217;s been bugging me personally and I&#8217;m sure many of you for a very long time. In the past, there hasn&#8217;t been a comprehensive list of TextMate 2 features. The remaining features to be added to this release are hidden from the general public which causes a lot of speculation on exactly <strong>WHAT</strong> will be in TextMate 2.</p>

<p>But fear not dear TextMate lover/fanatic/fetishist! There is a website for you to view the coming features in TextMate 2 <strong>and even suggest your own!</strong> This site is http://fixedbytm2.com and, as you can now probably see, shows you, <strong><em>in bite-sized pieces so you're not too overwhelmed</em></strong> exactly what features and bugs are going to be fixed in TextMate 2!</p>

<p>The code&#8217;s <a href='http://github.com/radar/fixedbytm2'>available on github</a>, naturally.</p>
