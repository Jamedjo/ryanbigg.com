    <a href='http://github.com/radar/projectr/tree/master'>Project R</a>
<p>The non-abbreviated version of the name &#8220;Project R&#8221; is &#8220;Project Ryan-is-bored-so-will-attempt-to-do-this-seemingly-interesting-task-to-further-his-knowledge&#8221;, but I think &#8220;Project R&#8221; rolls better off the tongue than that. Yes, it&#8217;s not pretty but it&#8217;s functional! Let me know what you think of it!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s now hosted on Heroku: <a href='http://projectr.heroku.com'>http://projectr.heroku.com</a></p>
