        <small>30 Jun 2009</small><br>
        <p>Today two amazing things happened and I would like to share them with you in a two-part series (woah, look at me going all high-tech on my reader). Here&#8217;s the first:</p>
<h2>Hampton Catlin</h2>
<p>Today <a href='http://hamptoncatlin.com/'>Hampton Catlin</a> was talking with <a href='http://drnicwilliams'>Dr Nic</a> about Ruby 1.9 issues he was having with his <a href='http://github.com/hcatlin/wikimedia-mobile/tree/master'>wikimedia-mobile</a> project, specifically he was getting <span class='term'>incompatible character encodings: ASCII-8BIT and UTF-8</span>. This is a guy I admire and look up to and think he&#8217;s &#8220;the shit&#8221;. He came to my company looking for help and it was my (and Bo&#8217;s) task to help him figure out what&#8217;s going on. Honoured.</p>

<p>The search box on his site was a bit wrong for fanciful languages like that German:</p>

<p>and some pages threw some more interesting errors:</p>
<img src='http://img.skitch.com/20090630-c94qy5kdspcm83n835yk63cawq.png' alt='Argument Error' />
<p>I&#8217;d seen this error before in <a href='http://frozenplague.net/2009/01/ruby-191-rubygems-rails/'>my Ruby 1.9 testing</a>, but that was so long ago that I had forgotten what context or even if I fixed it. Probably not.</p>

<p>I remembered someone linking to <a href='http://pragdave.blogs.pragprog.com/pragdave/2008/04/fun-with-ruby-1.html'>this post by Dave Thomas</a> a while ago but forgot the link, but thanks to <a href='http://google.com'>Google</a> I was able to enter &#8220;Ruby 1.9 encodings&#8221; and it knew <strong>exactly</strong> what I was after. I followed the &#8220;instructions&#8221; and put <span class='term'># encoding: utf-8</span> at the top of the merb executable and the <em>buffer.rb</em> file in HAML (which, it turns out had no bearing on the final result). No luck. Then Hampton mentioned he put -KU on the end of the ruby interpreter which randomly fixed/broke random things. So I tried that, and got a couple of degrees of success.</p>

<p>I opened up <span class='term'>irb1.9 -KU</span> (yeah, I&#8217;m so cool I have <strong>two</strong> versions of Ruby installed, <strong>at the same time</strong>) and I knew of the <span class='term'>encoding</span> method you could call on a string in order to get the encoding of that string. So I tried something simple: <span class='term'>"Ryan".encoding</span> which gave <span class='term'>UTF-8</span> so I tried the German text and I wasn&#8217;t surprised when that also returned <span class='term'>UTF-8</span>. So what&#8217;s going on?</p>

<p>Well, turns out that <strong>even though we specified</strong> <span class='term'># encoding: utf-8</span> in the merb executable and even in a <span class='term'>meta</span> tag in the HTML, the HAML that was getting sent to the parser was being sent in ASCII-8BIT! Around this point Bo came in and we discovered the lovely <span class='term'>force_encoding</span> method for strings in order to&#8230; well, I&#8217;m sure you can figure it out.</p>
<a href='http://github.com/nex3/haml/blob/a4f0471c5be4640029f6deaca5d6ded45e15725c/lib/haml/buffer.rb#L137'>This is the misbehaving line in haml 2.0.9</a>
<p>Hampton was happy, we were happy, and karma rewarded me with a delicious steak sandwich + icecream with banana slices with maple syrup on top.</p>
