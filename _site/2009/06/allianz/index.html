        <small>18 Jun 2009</small><br>
        <p>When I moved to Queensland I quickly realised that there&#39;s no <a href='http://communitycps.com.au'>CommunityCPS</a> branches up here in the sunshine state so it was suggested that I change to <a href='http://www.commbank.com.au'>The Commonwealth Bank</a> which I did and was painless. I changed every single point of debiting from the account I could find except for iPower (my hosting company, my mistake) and Allianz.</p>

<p>Fucking Allianz.</p>

<p>So I call them up about a month or so ago and say &quot;Hey guys, about my insurance with you... I want to change the bank account it&#39;s debited out of it.&quot; The guy on the other end of the phone sounds like a McLackey, but my faith in large-corporation call-centers is about as existent as God, so I&#39;m unphased by this. What I was phased by however he said: </p>

<p><em><strong>We do not have an account with that name, or that license plate in our systems.</strong></em>. </p>

<p>So I give him every single shred of information I can think of that would link to me, my old addresses, phone numbers, everything. According to him I didn&#39;t exist. So who were the $109.31 monthly debits going to?</p>

<p>Fucking Allianz.
That&#39;s who.
Said so on the bank statement.</p>

<p>So I get a little pissy with the guy and say &quot;Righto, I&#39;ll just close the account and you can have your people call my people and we&#39;ll change the details then?&quot; The guy&#39;s shocked, says &quot;Alri..&quot; and I hang up.</p>

<h3>Today</h3>

<p>Today  I get a call from my old bank and they say there&#39;s a <strong>negative</strong> amount on my <strong>debit</strong> account which should never happen. I&#39;m told that if I deposit the $109.31 into the account then they can close that for me, which is what I should&#39;ve done a while ago. They&#39;ll send me out paperwork too (yet another company who fails to realise the year is 2009), but what can you do? I guess I could plant a tree or something.</p>

<p>Then I get a call back from them. They ask if I want to cancel my car insurance along with my account. I go &quot;lolwut&quot; or something to that effect, and the lady explains that I have insurance being debited out of my old account and that they &quot;honor&quot; Allianz which is why I had a negative amount. We then go through the process of changing my payment details to my Commonwealth account and my address to my new place, then all is well.</p>

<p>Just annoyed that Allianz has <strong>no record</strong> of CommunityCPS&#39;s account with me, and also at myself for not remembering I had insurance with my bank, not with Allianz itself.</p>
