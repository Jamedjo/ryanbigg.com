    <p>Over the past month or so I&#8217;ve learned to dislike Integrity for all it&#8217;s quirks. Whilst it&#8217;s a fabulous piece of software <strong>in theory</strong> the bugs (&#8220;notify_of_build&#8221; fails, attempting to press &#8220;rebuild&#8221; attempts to go to a page that doesn&#8217;t exist, etc.) and it&#8217;s single threadedness has driven myself (and others) up the wall.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday I was in The Zone, and coded <a href='http://github.com/radar/construct'>Construct</a> effectively <strong>that night</strong>. It was as functional as integrity and didn&#8217;t hang when there was a build in progress! It works by running on port 80 and uses Github&#8217;s &amp; Codebase&#8217;s post-receive hooks (you&#8217;ll have to set them up yourself I&#8217;m afraid).</p>

<p>So go try it out for yourself! Interested in your feedback for it.</p>
