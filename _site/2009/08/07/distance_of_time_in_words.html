    <p>I was infatuated with this method when I first saw Rails but I&#8217;ve seen a couple of people recently express that Rails&#8217; built in <span class='term'>distance_of_time_in_words</span> is not accurate enough, showing something like &#8220;about 2 years&#8221; rather than &#8220;2 years, 21 days, 5 hours, and 6 minutes&#8221;. With some help from chendo at <a href='http://mocra.com'>Mocra</a> (where I work) I&#8217;ve made <a href='http://github.com/radar/dotiw'>a new distance_of_time_in_words</a> which should be a drop-in replacement for the old crappy one. To install it, use: <span class='term'>script/plugin install git://github.com/radar/dotiw.git</span>. This also comes with another method if you&#8217;re still picky about the output: <span class='term'>distance_of_time_in_words_hash</span> which gives you a Hash containing keys in your native tongue. The README should give you a good guide of what other options it supports too.</p>
