        <p>There&#8217;s a couple of Ruby libraries out there for interacting with Github&#8217;s API but one caught my attention through recommendation through IRC channels, and that was <a href='http://github.com/fcoury/octopi'>Octopi by fcoury</a>. Octopi covers just about everything the Github API has to offer and I was going to use it for a Rails Rumble project so I did some work on it, but pulled out from the competition due to flu &amp; other commitments. In the past couple of days, I nagged fcoury about closing some of the issues on the project and he&#8217;s made me a collaborator on the project so I could do it, as his time is filled with <a href='http://webbynode.com'>Webbynode</a> (they are awesome, check them out) stuff instead.</p>

<p>So I guess I all I have to say is: Go use the Octopi library for your Github stuff. It&#8217;s awesome.</p>
