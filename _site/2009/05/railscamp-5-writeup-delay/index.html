        <small>21 May 2009</small><br>
        <p>I have every intention of eventually doing a writeup on how my Railscamp #5 was but unfortunately I&#8217;ve come down with a flu. It is unknown to me at the present moment if it is the standard flu or swine-flu. I don&#8217;t care either way. I&#8217;m on meds and I&#8217;m taking a day, perhaps two, off work in order to recover. I&#8217;m also on ease-a-cold meds which aren&#8217;t helping at all. I cannot focus, and so I think that I&#8217;m not in the right state of mind to do a writeup on Railscamp #5. Sorry.</p>

<p>In other completely unrelated news, to the person(s) who had the flu at Railscamp: I will find you. It is only a matter of time.</p>
