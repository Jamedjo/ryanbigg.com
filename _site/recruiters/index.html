        <p>Hello! You probably have been sent this page because you&#39;re a recruiter.</p>

<p><a href='https://au.linkedin.com/in/ryan-bigg-73379b9a'>My LinkedIn profile</a> says this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No recruiters, thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href='http://ryanbigg.com/about-me'>My &quot;About me&quot; page</a> has this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not actively looking for any more jobs. If you still really really really feel like contacting me about a job, <strong>include the phrase &quot;Bravo Foxtrot Uniform&quot;</strong>, just so I know you&#39;ve done your research. If you do not include this phrase, I will assume you have not done your research. I get contacted quite often by recruiters, and this phrase is what I use to weed out those who have done their research and those who haven&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re a recruiter and you&#39;re reading this page: you have probably already
failed my first two tests. You <em>didn&#39;t</em> include the magical phrase and you
<em>didn&#39;t</em> follow my precise &quot;no recruiters&quot; instructions.</p>

<p>I have these two checks in place for a <em>very</em> good reason: I get contacted by
a lot of people (recruiters and otherwise) about jobs, career opportunities,
and related things. these two tests are the only way that I know that you&#39;ve
done your research on me and that you&#39;ve figured out that I&#39;m an <em>especially</em>
good fit for the job, and not just another warm body. There are plenty of
places that could hire me for my warm-bodyness, and a select few that would
hire me for my skills and good fit into the company and their culture.</p>

  <a href="/recruiters/almost-successful.html">Read here about the time I was (almost) successfully recruited</a>
</small></p>

<p><strong>If you&#39;ve reached this page, you&#39;re treating me like a warm body.</strong> In my
professional experience, these kinds of job placements don&#39;t pan out well, and
so I&#39;m actively trying to avoid them.</p>

<p><strong>I will only consider job offers from people who have done their research.</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for respecting my wishes.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan Bigg</strong></p>
