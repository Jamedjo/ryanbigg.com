        <p>Hello! You probably have been sent this page because you&#39;re a recruiter.</p>

<p><a href='http://ryanbigg.com/about-me'>My &quot;About me&quot; page</a> has this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not actively looking for any more jobs. If you still really really really feel like contacting me about a job, <strong>include the phrase &quot;Bravo Foxtrot Uniform&quot;</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Followed immediately by:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No recruiters, thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re a recruiter and you&#39;re reading this page: you have probably already failed my first two tests. You <em>didn&#39;t</em> include the magical phrase and you <em>didn&#39;t</em> follow my precise &quot;no recruiters&quot; instructions.</p>

<p>All hope is not lost, however. Here&#39;s how you can be better at your job and get people to respect you.</p>

<h2>How to be a better recruiter</h2>

<p>There&#39;s this one weird tip that you can use to be a better recruiter.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a long-held secret, that only the best recruiters know about. If you&#39;re on this page, you don&#39;t know about it.</p>

<p>But I am willing to share it with you.</p>

<p>Are you ready?</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<h3>Actually care about the people who you&#39;re contacting.</h3>

<p>This works wonders. The only recruiter to have successfully approached me for a job interview has shown that they <em>cared</em> about me. That&#39;s all that you have to do. That is literally your job.</p>

<p>Can you do that for me? I would really appreciate it.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
