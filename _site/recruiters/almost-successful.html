      <h2></h2>
      <p>In 2010, I was contacted by a recruitment company who asked if I was
interested in a job working for a big corporation. This recruitement company
had done their research: they knew I was mildly competent at Rails, had
written some documentation, and that I was working on a book at the time.</p>

<p>I was unhappy with my current job and so I went for an interview with this big
corporation. I didn&#39;t feel comfortable being another small cog in the big
corporation&#39;s machinery, so I (politely) turned down the job.</p>

<p>A few years later, I was on the market again for a new job. Out of all the
recruiters that I had been contacted by over the years, I went back to this
same recruiter who tried to place me in 2010. We talked about the potential
jobs that they could place me in, but I found something outside of those and
worked there.</p>

<p>I went back to this recruiter becuase they showed that they genuinely cared
about my career and finding a great job to suit. While the 2010 job didn&#39;t pan
out, they still had done their research and they made me feel like they&#39;d had
used careful consideration deciding which companies I would be suitable for.</p>

<hr>

<p>Too many recruiters these days shotgun-blast a list of emails on a spreadsheet
without doing any more research into the people they&#39;re contacting. Sure,
recruiters <em>do</em> have to make their quotas. I believe that this 
shotgun-blasting is an inefficient method, and it is rude.</p>

<p>It shows a lack of care and empathy for the people being contacted. It also
shows that the recruiters using this methodology don&#39;t care <em>who</em> gets placed
in the job at the company. Recruiters are paid thousands of dollars per
candidate, and (it seems) a lot of recruiters don&#39;t care who they place in
what company. <strong>Because of this, I think that companies are getting a raw deal
from recruiters, and the employees are getting a raw deal as well.</strong></p>

<p>The only people that profit from this shotgun-blasting are the recruiters themselves.</p>

<p>This is why I ask anyone asking me about job opportunities to make sure that
they have <a href="/recruiters">done their research on me first</a>. I want to know that
they care about me just like that recruiter from the above story. I want to
know that they care about the company finding The Right Person and not Just
Another Warm Body.</p>

<p><strong>Recruiters: you catch more flies with honey than vinegar.</strong> When contacting
someone, show that you genuinely care about them. Attend the local meetups for
the languages you&#39;re hiring for. Socialise with the people you&#39;re potentially
hiring. Learn about them. Integrate with them. It&#39;s not rocket science.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll find that this is a much more effective method than shotgun-blasting a list of emails from a spreadsheet.</p>
