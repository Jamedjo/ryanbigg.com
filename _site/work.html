            <h2>I am currently looking for work.</h2>

<p class="large">
  I'm finishing up at Culture Amp at the end of November 2019. I'll be looking
  for work to begin in 2020.
</p>

<p>
  At Culture Amp, I have been running a Junior Engineering Program (JEP) for 2
  years, training two groups of junior developers -- about 20 people in total. I
  enjoyed this job so much that I would really love the opportunity to do
  something like that again at another company. You can read my
  <a href="/2018/08/culture-amp-junior-engineering-program-retrospective">
    JEP #1: Retrospective
  </a>
  and <a href="/2019/03/jep-2-first-8-weeks">JEP #2: The First 8 Weeks</a> to
  get a feel for the kind of work I accomplished during the running of the JEP.
  And you can read
  <a
    href="https://ryanbigg.com/2019/07/culture-amp-junior-engineering-program-discontinued"
    >to find out why I'm not running a third program</a
  >
  and why I'm currently looking for work.
</p>

<p>
  Before the JEP, I worked for over a decade in plenty of different spaces:
  developer relations, ecommerce and internet-of-things. I've been working with
  teams large and small, writing languages such as Elixir, Ruby, TypeScript,
  React, Ruby and Go.
</p>

<p>
  Alongside my regular full time work, I have have also written
  <a href="/books">almost 10 books on Ruby and Elixir</a> over my career that
  have combined sales of over 15,000 copies.
</p>

<h3>My Ideal Role</h3>

<p>
  I <em>loved</em> mentoring junior developers at Culture Amp. What mattered to
  me here is that I felt like I was making a difference in developers' lives,
  and I was consistently supported in whatever I wanted to accomplish. This is
  my happy place.
</p>

<p>
  I have an incredible passion for growing new developers, and this is what I
  would love to keep doing over the long-term. As such, I am currently not
  interested in any "senior developer" role, in any language. I would really
  rather be teaching and growing developers at the moment.
</p>

<p>
  Working on a team where I could mentor and grow the developers around me would
  be best. If that's coupled with building an exciting product then that is even
  better!
</p>

<p>
  (Or if someone was to pay me to mentor juniors <em>and</em> write books
  full-time then I'd be up for that too!)
</p>

<h4>FAQ</h4>

<p>
  <strong>Q: Would you like to relocate to [insert destination here]?</strong>
  No. I want to stay here in Melbourne, Australia and continue to work from this
  great city. I am not interested in relocating at the moment. My family has
  strong ties to this city.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >Q: We do onboarding for [a number] of weeks in our [remote] office. Would
    that be okay with you?</strong
  >
  No. I would be leaving my wife with our daughter for 6 weeks and that's not
  fair to anyone. Because my wife works full-time as a teacher, we cannot simply
  pack our bags and fly off somewhere for onboarding. An onboarding process I
  can do from Melbourne would be great.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >Q: Would you like to work with our team that is US-remote only? You would
    be our first remote hire.</strong
  >
  I'd prefer not to at this stage. I did this previously and found the feedback
  loop really long. I would prefer to keep working with companies that have an
  AU presence, even if that's just a team of developers instead of a full
  office.
