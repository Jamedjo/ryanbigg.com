            <h2>Working with me</h2>

<p class="large">
   If you're contacting me about a job: <em><strong>please include the phrase "Bravo Foxtrot Uniform"</strong></em>, just so I know that you've done your research. It at least lets me know you reached this page. I explain my reasoning for this <a href='/recruiters.html'>over here</a>.
</p>

<p class="large">The best way to contact me is <a href='mailto:me@ryanbigg.com'>via email</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/ryanbigg'>Twitter (@ryanbigg)</a>. However, before you contact me please read the rest of this page.

<p class="large">
  <strong>I am not currently looking for work. This means that you really, really should not contact me regarding any "new exciting opportunities" or the like.</strong> I'm running the Junior Engineering Program at <a href='https://cultureamp.com'>Culture Amp</a> from at least November 2017 until May 2018, so I'll be really busy during that time. I'll probably be busy after that time too, running the next cohort through the same program.
</p>

<p class="large">
  I am not willing to relocate away from Melbourne at this time. Any job offer for another city would <em>definitely</em> be wasting your time.
</p>

<h3>My Ideal Role</h3>

<p class="large">
  My ideal role is the one I'm currently in: mentoring junior developers at a large-ish company. I built this role myself, so I'm very keen on keeping it.
</p>

<p>
  I have an incredible passion for growing new developers, and this is what I would love to keep doing over the long-term. As such, I am currently not interested in any "senior developer" role at a company. I would really rather be teaching people at the moment.
</p>

<p>
  Or if someone was to pay me a decent wage to write books full-time then I'd be up for that too.
