   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During this Christmas break I&#39;ve been taking some time off from writing Multitenancy with Rails -- which I&#39;ll get back to <em>after</em> Christmas is over -- and instead of writing books I&#39;m reading them.</p>

<p><a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/phoenix/">Programming Phoenix</a> is the only book that I&#39;ve been reading so far. I&#39;ve now read through the whole thing. Despite that I&#39;ve filed over 40 errata on the book (hey, it is a beta book) I <em>mostly</em> enjoyed the book.</p>

<hr>

<p>Programming Phoenix takes you through building a complete Phoenix application, introducing familiar concepts like controllers, models and templates. Those parts are familiar because they&#39;re much the same in Phoenix as they are in Rails; with some differences. Models have changesets. Templates relate to Views. Unlike Rails&#39; &quot;magical&quot; callbacks (in both models and controllers), these are just simply defined and used functions in Phoenix.</p>

<p>The latter chapters cover a range of things, like adding in live &quot;annotations&quot; to a video as its being watched. Think of that kind of like a live chatroom, except as the video plays, the annotations from previous watches also appear. This is done using Websockets, which are supported in Rails now with ActionCable, but it just <em>feels</em> a lot less hacky with Phoenix than it does with Rails. Elixir handles it better, <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections">reaching two million connections recently</a> to a single (albeit quite beefy) server. I can&#39;t myself think of something to use Websockets for, but it is still exciting nevertheless.</p>

<p>The final two chapters, &quot;OTP&quot; (Open Telecom Platform) and &quot;Observer and Umbrellas&quot; cover some of the real strengths of Elixir and its underlying foundation of Erlang. These two chapters get you to build a system which connects to Wolfram Alpha&#39;s API, and then demonstrate how to keep this new system separate from the original application, while still being able to connect these two systems together and communicate between them. In the Ruby world, typically this would be done with HTTP calls, but in the Elixir world it is just a matter of communicating across Elixir processes. This inter-process communication is quite quick in comparison to HTTP because it doesn&#39;t have that overhead.</p>

<p>What I loved from these final chapters was seeing Elixir&#39;s supervision capabilities in action. In one of those latter chapters, you create a small application (<code>Rumbl.Counter</code>) which dies after a couple of seconds. A Supervisor for the main application (<code>Rumbl</code>) restarts this smaller application automatically when it dies. Ruby doesn&#39;t have that kind of capability; instead you need to rely on tools like upstart. It&#39;s quite nice having it built into the language because then you don&#39;t have to learn something completely different to ensure your servers don&#39;t fall over.</p>

<hr>

<p>The book is written by Jos&eacute; &quot;The Elixir Guy&quot; Valim, Chris &quot;The Phoenix Guy&quot; McCord and Bruce &quot;The <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks">Seven Languages</a> Guy&quot; Tate. It&#39;s great to see that it&#39;s the core developers who are invested in writing documentation for the community. Unlike a certain other community who has a main core developer who tells contributors to go fuck themselves when they ask for documentation regarding new features. Further to that point, both Jos&eacute; and Chris are extremely active on the #elixir-lang channel on Freenode, which is also great to see.</p>

<p>I am not sure if it is because the book has three authors, but there are some parts where I&#39;m reading it and enjoying it. Then there are sections like &quot;Anatomy of a Plug&quot; which goes <em>way too deep</em> into what a Plug is and how it works, and &quot;Exploring Ecto in the Console&quot; which, again, goes rather deep but doesn&#39;t tie that content <em>solidly</em> back to what we&#39;re doing in the book at that present moment. It&#39;d be like a fiction book <em>intricately</em> explaining what&#39;s in the house of the neighbour of the protagonist, but then the neighbour is not mentioned any more past that. </p>

<p>Like, why does it even matter that Ecto supports &quot;search functions like <code>ilike</code> and <code>like</code>&quot; or that Plug has <code>path_info</code> and <code>scheme</code> fields? Neither of those are relevant to the content at-hand at that point of time, and it feels disconnected. Those things should be mentioned in their respective guides, not in this book. Perhaps those sections will mysteriously disappear once this book reaches the production editing phase. </p>

<p>It feels like it would be better off showing what a Plug is within the context of the application... and they do that later on. Then after that go into the detail. But I could do without the pages and pages of extra seemingly &quot;useless&quot; info <em>before</em> I get hooked on what you&#39;re trying to sell.</p>

<p>In addition to that, there are some places where the content feels like it&#39;s saying &quot;we&#39;re going to do this now because I said we&#39;re going to do it&quot;; particularly in Chapter 5, the Authentication chapter. The chapter jumps to creating a registration changeset with no reason why it needs to be created, then later on explains why it has to be created. The explanation needs work there.</p>

<p>This is where the TDD/BDD of Rails 4 in Action holds up. In that book, it&#39;s more like &quot;we&#39;re going to do this because the test says we need to do it&quot;. Programming Phoenix saves that kind of testing for Chapter 8, with the given reason being that having testing throughout every chapter can be distracting and repetitive. While I can see the point there -- there was vigorous nodding over here reading Chapter 8&#39;s intro -- that very same testing can be helpful for demonstrating industry best-practices to newbies. Otherwise what you&#39;ll get is a bunch of newbies who read the first 7 chapters and think that writing code without tests is How It Is Done(tm). </p>

<p>Having tests also helps show off the usefulness of regression testing too. A thing broke and now we&#39;re going to write a test for a fix, watch the test go red, fix the thing, and watch the test go green. I think that kind of thing is helpful to newbies to have, as they&#39;re the most likely to make mistakes within their application.</p>

<p>Despite these complaints, the book has been worthwhile reading. I am mainly nitpicking, because I&#39;m an author of another programming book and I have moments where I think that I could write parts better. That has yet to be proven.</p>

<p>The parallels between Rails and Phoenix are helping with the learning of the new framework, and the differences between them are not too mind-bending to be beyond comprehension. The first 8 chapters cover topics that should be familiar to any Rails developer: starting a new project, adding in models and controllers. Adding validations to the model with changesets -- which are a <em>very</em> cool feature that I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Active Record 6.0 picked up. </p>

<p>The remaining 4 chapters of the book venture off into territory that is probably unexplored by most Rails developers. I know that I personally have never spent time using Websockets or having to do anything like inter-process communication in Ruby. These last four chapters were a breath of fresh air for my skills. I feel like I really learned something valuable in those chapters.</p>

<p>Overall, Programming Phoenix is a fantastic book that will become even better once the authors spend more time on it and the editors do their bit. I really recommend reading this book, but with a small caveat: read <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir">Programming Elixir</a> first to get familiar with the underlying language of the Phoenix framework. Then it&#39;ll be smooth sailing for you.</p>

   <title>Open source work</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2015/11/open-source-work"/>
   <updated>2015-11-16T00:00:00+11:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2015/11/open-source-work</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of today I am quitting all maintenance roles / responsibilities of any open source project I am involved in. I am now looking for maintainers for any of those projects. Volunteers can contact me@ryanbigg.com to discuss handovers.</p>

<p>I work full-time, a full 40 hours a week. Outside of that work, I am writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails-2">Multitenancy with Rails, 2nd Edition</a>. That work gets done primarily on my way into and out of the office, a 30 minute train journey one-way. I also spend the occasional weekend day doing some writing.</p>

<p>Outside of this full-time work, I have lots of &quot;life stuff&quot; that I&#39;d like to do. Things like spending time with my wife, going outside or just generally relaxing. Having open source emails sitting in my inbox during those times makes me feel guilty for doing those things instead of working on open source.</p>

<p>I do not have the time or energy to invest in open source any more. I am not being paid at all to do any open source work, and so the work that I do there is time that I could be spending doing &quot;life stuff&quot;, or writing. It is not fair to expect me to do <em>even more work</em> outside of my regular work, and then not get fairly compensated (time or money) for it. It&#39;s also a great recipe for burnout and making me just generally grumpy. To have an open source email sit in the inbox for days or weeks at a time just leads me to feeling more guilty about not having found time + energy to get to it yet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s for this reason that I&#39;ve decided to end all my engagements with open source effective today. I will not be responding to any comments, issues or pull requests that get filed on any repository that I am in charge of. The only thing I will be responding to (in this regard) is volunteers who want to take over the maintenance of the projects.</p>

<p>Thank you for respecting my decision.</p>

   <title>Active Record, change_column and scales</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2015/11/active-record-change_column-and-scales"/>
   <updated>2015-11-10T00:00:00+11:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2015/11/active-record-change_column-and-scales</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I discovered a fun quirk of Active Record today. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a bug or if it&#39;s just me doing something silly, but in these kinds of cases I&#39;ve learned to lean more towards the latter. Here&#39;s how it&#39;s done.</p>

<p>Start with a fresh Rails app, using MySQL:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">rails new shop -d mysql
</code></pre></div>
<p>Create a new <code>Variant</code> model:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">rails g model variant price:decimal
</code></pre></div>
<p>We just so happen to know that we need to specify a precision (numbers before the decimal) and scale (numbers after the decimal) for this column, and we (read: I) can never remember the syntax for that in the <code>generate</code> command, so we edit the migration to provide both a <code>precision</code> and <code>scale</code> for this column, turning it into this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CreateVariants</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Migration</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">change</span>
    <span class="n">create_table</span> <span class="ss">:variants</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">decimal</span> <span class="ss">:price</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">precision</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">scale</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span>

      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">timestamps</span> <span class="ss">null</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Running this migration with <code>rake db:migrate</code> will generate a <code>db/schema.rb</code> which looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Schema</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">define</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">version</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">20151110060233</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">create_table</span> <span class="s2">&quot;variants&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">force</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">:cascade</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">decimal</span>  <span class="s2">&quot;price&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>      <span class="ss">precision</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">scale</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
    <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">datetime</span> <span class="s2">&quot;created_at&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>                          <span class="ss">null</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
    <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">datetime</span> <span class="s2">&quot;updated_at&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>                          <span class="ss">null</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>A <code>show columns from variants;</code> MySQL query will show this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">+------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field      | Type          | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id         | int(11)       | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| price      | decimal(10,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| created_at | datetime      | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| updated_at | datetime      | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
+------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note here that the <code>price</code> field has a <code>precision</code> of 10 and <code>scale</code> of 2; that&#39;s indicated by <code>decimal(10,2)</code>. That&#39;s good, because that&#39;s what we specified inside our migration.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s stop here and create three variants in our console:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">rails console
Variant.create(price: 18.49)
Variant.create(price: 26.99)
Variant.create(price: null)
</code></pre></div>
<p>These are just for demonstration purposes. No real data was harmed in the writing of this blog post.</p>

<p>The <code>price</code> column here doesn&#39;t have a default value and it allows for null values. There&#39;s data in here already which has <code>null</code> and that just won&#39;t do, because we want prices to always be a decimal number to make it easy to manage in our code. Having to do <code>to_f</code> to convert <code>nil</code> to <code>0.0</code> is not that smart. We&#39;re better than that!</p>

<p>So we&#39;ll go ahead and create a new migration to do the the <code>default</code> and <code>null</code> modifications to this <code>price</code> column:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">rails g migration add_default_to_variants_price
</code></pre></div>
<p>Inside that migration, we write this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">AddDefaultToVariantsPrice</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Migration</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">change</span>
    <span class="no">Variant</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">price</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update_all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;price = 0&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">change_column</span> <span class="ss">:variants</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:price</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:decimal</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">default</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">null</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Pretty simple stuff. We change all the variants where the price is <code>nil</code> (<code>null</code>) to have a price set to <code>0</code>. Then we set the <code>default</code> to be <code>0.0</code> and also tell it that we don&#39;t want <code>null</code> values in this column. If we didn&#39;t do the <code>update_all</code> call first, AR would bomb out because we tried to set <code>null: false</code> on a column which already had nulls.</p>

<p>We then run this migration (<code>rake db:migrate</code>), and this is where things go bad.</p>

<p>To start with, let&#39;s open <code>rails console</code> and run <code>Variant.first</code>. This is the variant that has a price set to <code>26.99</code>. Well, it&#39;s not that any more:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">#&lt;Variant id: 1, price: 27,
</code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s now 27.</p>

<p>What happened? Let&#39;s look at our <code>schema.rb</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Schema</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">define</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">version</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">20151110061535</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span>

  <span class="n">create_table</span> <span class="s2">&quot;variants&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">force</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">:cascade</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">decimal</span>  <span class="s2">&quot;price&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>      <span class="ss">precision</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">default</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">null</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
    <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">datetime</span> <span class="s2">&quot;created_at&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>                            <span class="ss">null</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
    <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">datetime</span> <span class="s2">&quot;updated_at&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>                            <span class="ss">null</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Ok, that says it&#39;s got a <code>precision: 10</code>, but where&#39;s the scale from the first migration gone? It&#39;s gone away.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s confirm this in MySQL too:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">mysql&gt; SHOW COLUMNS from variants;
+------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field      | Type          | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id         | int(11)       | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| price      | decimal(10,0) | NO   |     | 0       |                |
| created_at | datetime      | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| updated_at | datetime      | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
+------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
</code></pre></div>
<p>The precision has stayed at 10, but the scale has changed to 0.</p>

<p>But why does this happen?</p>

<p>Because in the second migration, we didn&#39;t specify a precision and a scale.</p>

<p>Instead of this line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">change_column</span> <span class="ss">:variants</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:price</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:decimal</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">default</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">null</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We should have:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">change_column</span> <span class="ss">:variants</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:price</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:decimal</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">precision</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">scale</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">default</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">null</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Otherwise, it defaults to a precision of 10 and scale of 0 <em>and</em> helpfully rounds up your prices for you.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that handy?</p>

   <title>My self-publishing success story</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2015/08/my-self-publishing-success-story"/>
   <updated>2015-08-06T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2015/08/my-self-publishing-success-story</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everyone loves a good success story. Here&#39;s mine. I&#39;ll cover my experience
going through a traditional publisher with Rails 3 in Action and have that
fail, and then discovering joy and happiness through the path of self-
publishing my own books through Leanpub.</p>

<h3>Rails 3 in Action</h3>

<p>I was approached in 2010 to write a book called <a href="https://manning.com/katz">Rails 3 in
Action</a>. I was so very excited to join that project
and write a book. Excited because up until that point, the longest thing that
I had written was a few of the Rails guides and my own blog posts. A book
would be an excellent way to share my knowledge about Rails with the worldwide
Rails community. So I signed up.</p>

<p>Then it didn&#39;t go so well. I wrote about that in a couple of other blog posts, mainly <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2011/11/don-t-print-hard-copies">&quot;Don&#39;t Print Hard Copies&quot;</a>, <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/the-writing-process">&quot;The Writing Process&quot;</a> and <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2012/11/no-more-writing-for-manning/">&quot;No more writing for Manning&quot;</a>. The long and short of it is that I found Manning incredibly hard to work with due to their tooling and my tendency to want to control everything from how the book looks to when I push updates to its content.</p>

<p>So I quit that project because it was causing me a lot of stress to have to
deal with the tooling and to not be in control of things.</p>

<p>Then I rejoined it again in November last year because Steve Klabnik burned
out from the tooling and writing process, and also because I wanted to not
have Steve&#39;s work go to waste. I brought on Rebecca Skinner as a co-author at
that time too. We set about updating the content for Rails 4.2.</p>

<p>Then I quit again in April of this year due to the same reasons I quit the
first time and let Rebecca finish off the book. It&#39;s currently going through
proofing through Manning&#39;s processes. And by &quot;currently&quot; I mean it&#39;s been in
there since April. 3 months to proof and print a book seems a bit long in my
opinion, but what can you do about it?</p>

<h3>Multitenancy with Rails</h3>

<p>After I quit Rails 3 in Action I was burned out quite heavily. I took time off
from writing and at the end of 2011 I moved from Sydney to Melbourne. Then when I got to Melbourne,
I had the itch to write something again: <a href="https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails">a book about building a multitenanted Rails application</a>. I talked with my friends Phil Arndt, Josh Adams and Rob Yurkowski about this project, and somehow <a href="https://leanpub.com">Leanpub</a> came up.</p>

<p>Leanpub lets you write books in Markdown and upload that Markdown to a Dropbox
folder. To push new updates, you go into your account&#39;s dashboard and hit the
&quot;Publish&quot; button. This was a welcome change from writing in XML and uploading
books to an SVN server and then using a website built in the late-90s or early
&#39;00s!</p>

<p>(Alternatively, you can generate your own files and upload them to Leanpub too if you don&#39;t want to write in Markdown. This is what I&#39;ve been doing for <a href="https://leanpub.com/ddr">Deep Dive Rails</a> and it&#39;s working wonders. More on that in probably a different blog post.)</p>

<p>The switch to Leanpub was... it was life-changing. Publishing a book didn&#39;t
have to be hard! I could just push a button whenever I felt like it and the
readers could be reading what I wrote in a matter of minutes. Leanpub made
everything so much easier compared with Manning.</p>

<p>I wrote Multitenancy with Rails over about a year and all the while during
that time, something interesting was happening: people were buying the book
and I was getting money for it each month. I originally sold the book for $10
and then raised the price $5 for every chapter that I completed. This way, it
gave people the incentive to get on board (Rails pun!) with reading the book
before it was complete.</p>

<p>This had two awesome effects:</p>

<ol>
<li>I would get money each month as more people bought it.</li>
<li>I would get feedback on the early drafts from readers.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Royalties</h3>

<p>Here&#39;s the royalties chart for all of my income from Leanpub since Feb 2012 to the current day.</p>

<p><img src="/images/success-story/leanpub-royalties.png" alt="Leanpub Royalties"></p>

<p>Contrast it with the royalties I get from Manning from June 2010 to the current day:</p>

<p><img src="/images/success-story/manning-royalties.png" alt="Manning Royalties"></p>

<p>To be fair, the dry-spell since January 2012 is partly because Manning
overpaid my royalties by $3.8k. Just a small clerical error, I&#39;m sure. But
since then, Rails 4 in Action has been earning money I haven&#39;t seen anything
for our work on it.</p>

<p>The monthly income is a great motivator to the writing process because it&#39;s a
monthly reminder that people think it&#39;s worthwhile buying and (probably)
reading the books that I publish on Leanpub.</p>

<p>Secondly, the royalty split between Leanpub is much nicer: they take a 10%
slice of the royalties, + 50 cents. This means that when I sell a book for
$20, I make $17.50 from that, and Leanpub makes $2.50. Roughly 35% of that
$17.50 ($6.125) goes to tax, but the rest ($11.35) is mine to keep. I <em>might</em>
get some of that tax back in the form of a tax return, but it&#39;s not something that I expect.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a pie chart:</p>

<p><img src="/images/success-story/leanpub-royalty-split.png" alt="Leanpub Royalties split"></p>

<p>For Manning, it&#39;s harder to break this down because the royalty rates vary
between 12.5% for print books, and 50% for ebooks. I get a royalty statement
from Manning every quarter for Rails 3 in Action which has the numbers so I
can attempt to break it down. I don&#39;t yet get a royalty statement for Rails 4
in Action because it has not been published.</p>

<p>Rails 3 in Action has sold 2,003 print books and 2,371 ebooks. I had expected
these numbers to be more skewed towards ebooks, but there you go. The price
has been the same forever: $50 for the print book with a free ebook (counted
as a print book sale) or $40 for just the ebook. So with those numbers in
mind, the total made for Rails 3 in Action over all time has been $100,150 for
the print books and $94,480 for the ebooks, which is a grand total of $194,630.</p>

<p>Using the royalty split above, we can work that out that the authors get 12.5%
of $100,150, which is $12,518.75 for print books and 50% of $94,480 which is
$47,240. A grand total of $59,758.75.</p>

<p>The rest of the money, 87.5% of $100,150 ($87,631.25) and 50% of $94,480
($47,240) goes to Manning. A grand total of $134,871.25.</p>

<p>Using those figures, I can generate a pie chart similar to the Leanpub one above:</p>

<p><img src="/images/success-story/manning-royalty-split.png" alt="Manning Royalties split"></p>

<p>(Tax isn&#39;t shown on this chart because the &quot;Authors&quot; royalties are split
between Yehuda and myself and we pay different tax rates. While I know my tax
rate, I don&#39;t know Yehuda&#39;s!)</p>

<p>Manning receives over two-thirds of the money earned for Rails 3 in Action and
will earn the same split for Rails 4 in Action. This is a personal sore point
for me, because I&#39;m a greedy bastard and for plenty of other reasons. For
instance, it makes sense that the royalties earned for a print book are low,
because producing print books takes effort, time and money. So that&#39;s logical.
But a 50/50 cut for ebooks seems a bit, well, unbalanced.</p>

<p>Clearly though, publishing my books through Leanpub is the better option if
what I&#39;m optimising for is money. Leanpub gets 10% + 50c of whatever book I
sell. Manning gets between 50-87.5%, which is almost 4-7 times as much as
Leanpub.</p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t optimise for money. If your intention is to write a book for
the sole purpose of earning extra dollar dollar bills, then I have some advice
for you: you&#39;re damn crazy and you shouldn&#39;t write it because the probability
of you earning enough money to be happy is extremely low. Books don&#39;t earn
even close to a sustainable level of income.</p>

<p>What I optimise for is (selfishly) my own happiness first, then reader
happiness a very close second. My reasoning for that is that if I don&#39;t enjoy
writing a book, then the book won&#39;t be very fun to read. My own happiness
comes first to make sure that a good book comes out at the end.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a nice segue into our next topic: writing tools and feedback cycles.</p>

<h3>Writing tools and feedback cycles</h3>

<p>When publishing a book, you kinda want to know immediately if anyone&#39;s reading
it. Peoeple <em>buying</em> the book is different to people <em>reading</em> the book. A
good indicator for this is the feedback that comes through in the form of,
mostly, errata reporting. Errata reporting means that people found errors in
the book, and that means that they read the book! That&#39;s great!</p>

<p>Fixing those errata reports quickly is essential to producing a high-quality
book. The faster you can kick out a new edition of the book and solve the
error, the sooner it&#39;ll be that nobody will ever come across <em>that</em> particular
error again.</p>

<p>With Manning, the process was this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find mistake in book and fix it.</li>
<li>Commit the fix to SVN.</li>
<li>Get rejected for the commit because some other author has pushed their book to SVN since the last time you did.</li>
<li>Checkout from SVN.</li>
<li>Commit the fix to SVN for real.</li>
<li>Go to Manning&#39;s author-only site and login.</li>
<li>Find your book in the list of books.</li>
<li>Click the gear icon.</li>
<li>Find the chapter that you updated.</li>
<li>Scroll down the list of revisions for that chapter.</li>
<li>Click the radio button to select &quot;Latest&quot; (which uses the latest version of that chapter) and then click &quot;Update&quot;. This flags this particular revision to be ready for Manning&#39;s system. </li>
<li>Wait for someone from Manning to publish a new MEAP copy, which can take weeks.</li>
</ol>

<p>12 steps and it takes a couple of weeks (usually) until the book is updated. Oh, and at step #11 you might be told that somewhere in your 2,000+ line XML file, something is invalid.</p>

<p>With Leanpub, the process is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find mistake in book and fix it.</li>
<li>Commit change to GitHub.</li>
<li>Copy file to Dropbox folder. (can be optional if you get Leanpub to read from GitHub!)</li>
<li>Go to Leanpub&#39;s author-only area for the book.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Publish&quot;, &quot;Publish New Version&quot;</li>
<li>Hit the big blue button &quot;Publish new version&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<p>6 steps and the book is available instantly for readers! Markdown doesn&#39;t fail
to compile when it&#39;s invalid, it just looks weird and the weirdness is generally quite obvious (everything is plus-sized after a certain point, for instance) and so it&#39;s easy enough to fix.</p>

<p>During the publishing process you can enter release notes as well. On Leanpub,
the choice to release a new version of a book is in the hands of the author,
and not the publishing company. This is the way it should be: the author
typically has one book on the go, whereas a publishing company has many. This
6-step process is the kind of process I could only dream about when writing
Rails 3 in Action.</p>

<p>For readers to send feedback to a Manning book they have to submit new topics
to a forum. This makes it really hard to track which topics have been
addressed and which haven&#39;t. For the update of Rails 4 in Action, we created a
repository on GitHub at
<a href="https://github.com/rubysherpas/r4ia">rubysherpas/r4ia</a> and asked readers to
file issues there. That way, when we fixed an issue on the book properly, we
could close it with a simple commit message like &quot;Fixes rubysherpas/r4ia#10&quot;.</p>

<p>If I was collaborating on a book again, I would definitely go down the GitHub
repo-for-errata path again because it makes that aspect of the writing process
so much simpler.</p>

<p>For Multitenancy with Rails, I&#39;ve gone with more of a personal approach: I&#39;ve
included my email in the foreword to the book and asked if people encounter
errors that they email me directly. This system works really well as I use the
unarchived emails as an indication of what book bugs haven&#39;t been fixed yet.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I wrote this post to answer questions that I get from people who ask what the
writing process was like. The two main things that I tell people that bugged
me about writing for a publisher were the writing tools and the royalty split.</p>

<p>Bad writing tools definitely hampered my ability to write, especially when I
spent a lot of my time fighting SVN to accept my files, or tracking down where
the XML files were invalid. Using Markdown, GitHub, and Leanpub&#39;s Dropbox
integration is one of the winning combinations for writing a book, and it&#39;s
what I use for <a href="https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails">Multitenancy with Rails</a>.</p>

<p>I use Asciidoc and GitHub for writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/ddr">Deep Dive Rails</a>. It took a little while to learn how the <code>asciidoctor</code> gem worked and then a little more time to figure out the PDF configuration, but it&#39;s looking really great now and I can tweak it very easily. I have control of what my book looks like! As an author, that&#39;s a pretty exciting thing because a book is a personal thing.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time messing around with the <code>asciidoctor</code> gem but
it&#39;s been way more fun than bashing my head against SVN or XML. It&#39;s way more
understandable, for starters!</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing that can be done about the royalty split for Rails 3/4 in
Action. To be frank about it, I signed a contract that allows Manning to take
full ownership of Rails 3/4 in Action and to pay me what they pay me. It means
that even if I ask them super-nicely (and not-so-super-nicely), they still
won&#39;t give me the rights to the book. It&#39;s absolutely my fault, and I have
learned my lesson from that. I&#39;ve fulfiled my end of the bargain, and here&#39;s
hoping that they (again) fulfil theirs by paying us authors the royalties we
get.</p>

<p>What I can do in the future is avoid publishers altogether and just continue
self-publishing. It&#39;s what I advise anyone who&#39;s considering writing a book
these days. Self-publishing allows you to get your book out there faster than
through a traditional publisher and you get to have complete control of it.</p>

   <title>Deploying a Rails application on Ubuntu: Passenger Edition</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2015/07/deploying-a-rails-application-on-ubuntu-passenger-edition"/>
   <updated>2015-07-08T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2015/07/deploying-a-rails-application-on-ubuntu-passenger-edition</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this guide, I&#39;ll cover the basics of deploying a Rails application to Ubuntu 14.04 on a Digital Ocean box. This guide will work on non-Digital-Ocean boxes too, and it might work on different Ubuntu versions. Try it out and find out :)</p>

<p>If you find any mistakes in this guide, please let me know in the comments below.</p>

<p>In the guide, we&#39;ll be using:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install"><strong>ruby-install</strong></a>: To install a Ruby version system-wide.</li>
<li><strong>nginx</strong>: A webserver to serve our Rails application with.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/"><strong>Passenger</strong></a>: The proxy between nginx and Rails which automatically starts + stops Rails application &quot;worker processes&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Capistrano</strong>: A very helpful tool that automates your deployment workflow.</li>
</ul>

<p>While you <em>could</em> serve traffic from your production site using <code>rails s</code>, there are many issues with that:</p>

<ol>
<li>It runs on port 3000, whereas most websites run on port 80.</li>
<li>If it dies, you will need to restart it manually.</li>
<li>It will crash under heavy load because the web server it uses (WEBrick) has not been designed for production use.</li>
</ol>

<p>So instead, we&#39;ll be using nginx and Passenger.</p>

<p>Before we can run our Ruby on Rails application on the server, we&#39;ll need to install Ruby.</p>

<h2>Installing a Ruby version</h2>

<p>In order to install Ruby, we&#39;ll need to install the <code>build-essential</code> package. This package gives us the build tools that we&#39;ll need to compile Ruby.</p>

<p>We first need to make sure that our <code>apt</code> sources are up-to-date. If they&#39;re not, installing the <code>build-essential</code> pcakage might fail. We will do this by logging into the machine as root, and then running this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">apt-get update
</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we&#39;ll need to install the <code>build-essential</code> package itself:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre></div>
<p>With those tools installed, we will now install a Ruby version with the <code>ruby-install</code> tool. Follow the <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install#install">install steps for ruby-install</a> (reproduced here for your convienience):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">wget -O ruby-install-0.5.0.tar.gz https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install/archive/v0.5.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ruby-install-0.5.0.tar.gz
cd ruby-install-0.5.0/
make install
</code></pre></div>
<p>We will now install Ruby 2.2.2 system-wide by running this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby-install --system ruby 2.2.2 -- --disable-install-rdoc
</code></pre></div>
<p>We&#39;re installing it system-wide so that it&#39;s available for all users on this machine.  The <code>--disable-install-rdoc</code> tells Ruby to skip the part about installing RDoc documentation for Ruby on this machine. This is a production machine and we don&#39;t need RDoc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eventually, we&#39;ll be having each application have its own user on this machine. While we <em>could</em> use <code>ruby-install</code> on a per-user basis, it makes much more sense (and is easier!) to have it on a system-wide level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once that command finishes running, let&#39;s remove the <code>ruby-install</code> package + directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">rm -r ~/ruby-install-*
</code></pre></div>
<p>It might make sense at this point to install Rails, but we should definitely let Bundler take care of that during the application deployment process. Let&#39;s just install Bundler for now:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">gem install bundler
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Deploying the application</h2>

<p>To deploy the application, we&#39;re going to use a gem called Capistrano. Capistrano has been a mainstay of the Ruby community for some time now due to its flexibility and reliability.</p>

<p>With Capistrano, we&#39;ll be able to (git) clone the Rails application to the server and run any necessary configuration steps that are required to get our application running, such as <code>bundle install</code>, <code>rake assets:precompile</code>, and configuring a database.</p>

<h3>Creating a new user</h3>

<p>The first thing to do is to create a new user on the machine where we&#39;re deploying to for the application. This user will be sandboxed into its own directory, which means the application will only have access to that user&#39;s home directory. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we installed the application as root and Rails had a Remote Code Execution vulnerability, the box could get taken over by some malicious hackers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s create this new application user now:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">useradd -d /home/rails_app -m -s /bin/bash rails_app
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>I&#39;ve used <code>rails_app</code> here just as an example. You should use your application&#39;s name.</strong></p>

<p>The <code>-d</code> option specifies the home directory of the user and the <code>-m</code> option tells <code>useradd</code> to create that directory if it doesn&#39;t already exist. The <code>-s</code> option tells it that we want to use the <code>/bin/bash</code> shell.</p>

<p>Next, we&#39;ll want to make it so that we can connect to the server as this user. This is so that when we deploy the application, we do so as the user that we just created. If you&#39;ve setup GitHub already, you probably already have setup an SSH key. If not, follow <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/">this excellent guide from GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To allow you to connect to the application server as the new user, we&#39;ll need to copy over the public key (<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>) to the server. The easiest way to do this is to copy it over to root first. On your own personal computer, run this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@yourmachine.example.com:~/key
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then on the server, move the key over to the new user&#39;s home directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">mkdir -p /home/rails_app/.ssh
mv key /home/rails_app/.ssh/authorized_keys
chown -R rails_app /home/rails_app/.ssh
chmod 600 /home/rails_app/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once you&#39;ve run those commands, you should be able to SSH into the machine as that user without requiring a password.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ssh rails_app@yourmachine.example.com
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you run <code>ruby -v</code> after connecting, you should see this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby 2.2.2p95 (2015-04-13 revision 50295) [x86_64-linux]
</code></pre></div>
<p>This indicates that Ruby can be found for your user, and that we can proceed to deploying the application.</p>

<p>Before we move onto the next section, we&#39;ll need to generate a &quot;deploy key&quot; for this user. This will be used by GitHub to grant this user access to the repository on GitHub.</p>

<p>We will generate that key by running this command on the server as our application&#39;s user:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ssh-keygen -t rsa
</code></pre></div>
<p>On our repository on GitHub, we can go to &quot;Settings&quot;, then &quot;Deploy Keys&quot; and add a new deploy key:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ubuntu-deploy-guide/add_deploy_key.png" alt="Add deploy key"></p>

<p>In the &quot;Title&quot; we can put whatever we feel like, but in the &quot;Key&quot; field we&#39;ll need to put the contents of the <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> file that the <code>ssh-keygen</code> command generated. Create the new deploy key now.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll need to set Git up on this machine so that we can clone the repo to test it out, and later to actually deploy the application. Let&#39;s install it now with this command <strong>ran as root</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">apt-get install git-core
</code></pre></div>
<p>Switch back to the <code>rails_app</code> user. We can test if this key is working by running <code>git clone git@github.com:you/example_app.git</code> (or whatever your repo is). If the key is setup correctly, then the clone will work.</p>

<h2>Deploying with Capistrano</h2>

<p>Next, we&#39;ll automate the deployment of our code to the server with Capistrano. We can install Capistrano as a gem dependency of the application by adding these two lines to the <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;capistrano-rails&#39;</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;capistrano-passenger&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can then run <code>bundle install</code> to install <code>capistrano-rails</code> and <code>capistrano-passenger</code> and their dependencies. To install Capistrano into our application, we&#39;ll need to run <code>bundle exec cap install</code>. This will install a couple of files in our application that will be used to configure how Capistrano deploys the application to our servers.</p>

<p>The first of these files is <code>config/deploy.rb</code>. Near the top of this file are these two lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:application</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;my_app_name&#39;</span>
<span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:repo_url</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;git@example.com:me/my_repo.git&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We will need to change the <code>application</code> to match the name of our application (<code>rails_app</code> is mine, but your application name is different!), and change the <code>repo_url</code> to be the <code>git@github.com</code> URL for our application. We should also change the path of the application so that it deploys to the home directory of the user:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:deploy_to</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/home/rails_app/app&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we&#39;ll need to tell Capistrano where to deploy the application to. We can do this by adding this as the first line in <code>config/deploy/production.rb</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">server</span> <span class="s1">&#39;app.example.com&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">user</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rails_app&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">roles</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="sx">%w{app db web}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, we&#39;ll need to tell Capistrano to run <code>bundle install</code> when the application is deployed, as well as to run the migrations and compile the assets. We can do this by uncommenting these lines in <code>Capfile</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;capistrano/bundler&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;capistrano/rails/assets&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;capistrano/rails/migrations&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;capistrano/passenger&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here&#39;s what each of those do:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>capistrano/bundler</code> is responsible for running <code>bundle install</code> (with some fancy deployment options as you&#39;ll see later) during an application deployment. This ensures that the gems on the server are up to date with whatever&#39;s specified in the <code>Gemfile.lock</code>.</li>
<li><code>capistrano/rails/assets</code> is responsible for precompiling the assets upon deploy.</li>
<li><code>capistrano/rails/migrations</code> is responsible for running the migrations for a new release (if any) during a new deploy.</li>
<li><code>capistrano/passenger</code> will restart the application on every single deploy, ensuring that only the latest code is running.</li>
</ul>

<p>This sets up most of the Capistrano configuration. There&#39;s a couple more pieces that we will address as they come up. </p>

<p>There&#39;s two more thing to do before we can deploy the application to the server: we&#39;ll need to install the development headers for whatever database system we&#39;re using and we&#39;ll need to install a JavaScript runtime. </p>

<h2>Database setup</h2>

<p>Install one of the following packages as the <code>root</code> user on that machine:</p>

<ul>
<li>By default, a Rails application uses SQLite3. To install SQLite3&#39;s development headers, run this command:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>If you&#39;re using MySQL, run:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>If you&#39;re using PostgreSQL, run:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">apt-get install libpq-dev
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you&#39;re using MySQL or PostgreSQL, you&#39;ll need to install their servers.</p>

<ul>
<li>For MySQL, the package to install is <code>mysql-server</code>.</li>
<li>For PostgreSQL, the package to install is <code>postgresql-9.3</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>JavaScript runtime</h2>

<p>My preferred JavaScript runtime is the <code>nodejs</code> package. You can install it with <code>apt-get install nodejs</code>. This package will be used by the server to during <code>rake assets:precompile</code> to precompile the JavaScript assets.</p>

<h2>Deploying the first version</h2>

<p>We can now run <code>bundle exec cap production deploy</code> to deploy our application to our server. The first deploy might be a bit slow while all the gem dependencies are installed on the server. Patience is required for this step.</p>

<p>When it&#39;s complete, the final line should look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">INFO [9fa64154] Finished in 0.194 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
</code></pre></div>
<p>Capistrano has set up your application directory and it has deployed it to a directory at <code>/home/rails_app/app/releases/&lt;timestamp&gt;</code>. This directory is unique to this release so that you may choose to rollback (with <code>bundle exec cap production rollback</code>) if something goes wrong.</p>

<p>Capistrano started out by cloning your application into the directory it created. It then:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ran <code>bundle install</code> to install your application&#39;s gem dependencies.</li>
<li>Ran <code>rake assets:precompile</code> to precompile your application&#39;s assets.</li>
<li>Ran <code>rake db:migrate</code> to migrate the production database for the application up to the latest version.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next step Capistrano will do is symlink the release directory to <code>/home/rails_app/app/current</code>. This is so that we have a sensible name with which to access the current release of our application.</p>

<p>At the end of all of that, it will also check the number of releases in the application directory. If there are more than 5, it will delete the oldest ones and keep only the 5 most recent. Again: these are kept around so that you may choose to rollback if something goes wrong.</p>

<p>With the application deployed, let&#39;s get it to serve our first production request by installing nginx + Passenger and then configuring them.</p>

<h2>Installing nginx + Passenger</h2>

<p>We can install a standalone edition of nginx using the Passenger installer, which massively simplifies what we&#39;re about to do. Without it, we would need to install nginx and Passenger, then we would need to configure these to work with each other.</p>

<p>Before we can install that, we&#39;ll need to install one more package:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
</code></pre></div>
<p>This installs Curl development headers with SSL support, which Passenger uses during the installation process.</p>

<p>To install Passenger, we will run <code>gem install passenger</code>, as root.</p>

<p>Next, we&#39;ll need to install Passenger and nginx, which we will do by running <code>passenger-install-nginx-module</code> and following the steps. We want to select Ruby when it prompts us for which languages we&#39;re interested in, of course. When it asks if we want Passenger to download + install nginx for us, we&#39;ll select the first option; &quot;Yes: download, compile and install Nginx for me.&quot;</p>

<p>This is another part where we&#39;ll need to wait a bit while Passenger compiles all the things it needs. Once it&#39;s done, it will tell us to put this configuration in our nginx config:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">server {
   listen 80;
   server_name www.yourhost.com;
   root /somewhere/public;   # &lt;--- be sure to point to &#39;public&#39;!
   passenger_enabled on;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>listen</code> directive tells nginx to listen for connections on port 80. The <code>server_name</code> directive is the address of your server, and you should change this from <code>www.yourhost.com</code> to whatever your server is. The <code>root</code> directive tells nginx where to find the application. The <code>passenger_enabled</code> directive should be very obvious.</p>

<p>Open <code>/opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf</code> and delete the <code>server</code> block inside the <code>http</code> block, and replace it with the above example. Update the values in the example to be specific to your application.</p>

<p>You can start nginx by running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">/opt/nginx/sbin/nginx
</code></pre></div>
<p>If we try to access our application now, we&#39;ll see a &quot;Incomplete response received from application&quot; error. In order to diagnose one of these, we can look in <code>/opt/nginx/logs/error.log</code>, which will tell us what caused that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*** Exception RuntimeError in Rack application object (Missing `secret_token` and `secret_key_base` for &#39;production&#39; environment, set these values in `config/secrets.yml`) (process 5076, thread 0x007fd841f79d58(Worker 1)):
</code></pre></div>
<p>It&#39;s telling us that we&#39;re missing the <code>secret_token</code> and <code>secret_key_base</code> for the production environment in <code>config/secrets.yml</code>. If we look at our application&#39;s <code>config/secrets.yml</code>, we&#39;ll see indeed that this is missing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">development:
  secret_key_base: [redacted]

test:
  secret_key_base: [redacted]

# Do not keep production secrets in the repository,
# instead read values from the environment.
production:
  secret_key_base: &lt;%= ENV[&quot;SECRET_KEY_BASE&quot;] %&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>While the comment above the production key (and the code itself!) says to read it from the environment, I personally think it&#39;s easier to have a <code>config/secrets.yml</code> with the secret key kept on the server itself, and then have that copied over on each deploy.</p>

<h2>Generating a secret key</h2>

<p>To that end, we will put a <code>config/secrets.yml</code> in the <code>/home/rails_app/app/shared</code> directory and tell Capistrano to copy that file over during deployment. We&#39;re creating the file in the <code>shared</code> directory because it&#39;s going to be a file that is shared across all releases of our application.</p>

<p>To generate the <code>secret_key_base</code> value for the production key inside the new <code>config/secrets.yml</code> file, we will run <code>rake secret</code> inside our application. This will give you a very long key, such as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">eaccffd1c5d594d4bf8307cac62cddb0870cdfa795bf2257ca173bedabc389a399b066e3b48cc0544604a4a77da38b9af4b46448fdad2efac9b668a18ad47ddf
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t use this one, because it is not secret! Generate one yourself.</strong></p>

<p>When you&#39;ve generated it, log into the server as <code>rails_app</code> and create a new file at <code>/home/rails_app/app/shared/config/secrets.yml</code> with this content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">production</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">secret_key_base</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;&lt;key</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">generated</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">by</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">rake</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">secret&gt;&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we&#39;ll need to uncomment the line in <code>config/deploy.rb</code> for the <code>linked_files</code> option. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">set :linked_files, fetch(:linked_files, []).push(&#39;config/secrets.yml&#39;)
</code></pre></div>
<p>We&#39;ve taken out <code>config/database.yml</code> for the time being just so we can confirm that we&#39;re passed this <code>secrets.yml</code> issue. After we&#39;ve dealt with that, we&#39;ll come back and look at creating a shared <code>database.yml</code>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s run another deploy now with <code>bundle exec cap production deploy</code>. This deploy should fix our <code>secrets.yml</code> problem. Making a request to the application might work now if you&#39;re using SQLite3. If not, then you&#39;ll need to wait until the next section is over before that will all work.</p>

<h2>Database configuration</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re not using SQLite3 in production, then you&#39;ll need to setup a database for your application. This guide will only configure PostgreSQL, since that is what I personally am most familiar with.</p>

<p>The first thing that you will need to do is to create a database + user in PostgreSQL for this user. To do that, run these commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">sudo su postgres
createdb rails_app
createuser rails_app
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>While the database name can be different to the username, the username that we use for PostgreSQL must be the same as the user that you use to SSH onto the server to deploy the application. When the application tries connecting to the database, it will do it using the same name as the user that the application runs under; which has been <code>rails_app</code> in this guide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We switch to the <code>postgres</code> user as it has superuser rights on our database which means it can execute the <code>createdb</code> and <code>createuser</code> commands. The <code>root</code> user of the machine cannot run these commands itself. You&#39;ll need to switch back from the postgres user back to root, which you can do by running <code>exit</code>.</p>

<p>Once we&#39;ve run those commands, we can test to see if it&#39;s working by running <code>psql</code> as the <code>rails_app</code> user. If it is working, then we will see a <code>psql</code> console like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">psql (9.3.9)
Type &quot;help&quot; for help.

rails_app=&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Great! Now we can setup the database configuration for the application. The first step is to change the database engine that the application uses in its <code>Gemfile</code> from <code>sqlite3</code> to the PostgreSQL gem, <code>pg</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;pg&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we will need to run <code>bundle install</code> to update our application&#39;s dependencies. We will need to ensure that we change our local <code>config/database.yml</code> to use PostgreSQL as well. You&#39;ll want to be using the same database software locally and on the server, as that means that you have identical environments across the different machines.</p>

<p>The next step is to put a <code>config/database.yml</code> in the <code>/home/rails_app/app/shared</code> directory which only contains a <code>production</code> key:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">production</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">adapter</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">postgresql</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">database</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">rails_app</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can copy this file over on deploy by updating <code>config/deploy.rb</code> and changing the <code>linked_files</code> line to this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:linked_files</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fetch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:linked_files</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">[]</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;config/database.yml&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;config/secrets.yml&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>We&#39;ll need to commit the changes to the <code>Gemfile</code> + <code>Gemfile.lock</code> before continuing here.</strong></p>

<p>The application will now work after one more run of <code>bundle exec cap production deploy</code>. Try it out yourself by visiting your app.</p>

<p>Your app should now be deployed to your server. Go ahead and try it out.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Your application is now deployed, but the fun doesn&#39;t stop here. You may need to tweak the <code>PassengerMaxInstances</code> configuration setting inside the <code>VirtualHost</code> block for your application to increase or decrease the amount of instances running on the machine, depending on how much free RAM you have. If you&#39;re running out of RAM, decrease this number. It entirely depends on the application, so just experiment to find out what value suits you.</p>

<p>The entire <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html">Passenger Users Guide</a> is a good read for other bits of tweaking too.</p>

<p>You may wish to setup exception tracking for your application now that it has been deployed to production, and for that I recommend <a href="https://rollbar.com">Rollbar</a>. It&#39;s very easy to setup for any Rails application and they have instructions on how to do that on their site.</p>

   <title>Mac OS X, Ruby, ruby-install, chruby and You</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2015/06/mac-os-x-ruby-ruby-install-chruby-and-you"/>
   <updated>2015-06-09T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2015/06/mac-os-x-ruby-ruby-install-chruby-and-you</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Last updated: December 7th, 2015</strong></p>

<p>
  <strong>This beginner's guide will set up with Ruby 2.2.3, chruby, ruby-install and Rails 4.2.5 and is specifically written for a <em>development</em> environment on Mac OS X, but will probably work on many other operating systems with slight modifications.</strong>
</p>

<p>This guide is <em>almost</em> a copy of my older <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2014/10/ubuntu-ruby-ruby-install-chruby-and-you/'>Ubuntu, Ruby, ruby-install, chruby, Rails and You</a> guide, but it's written primarily for Mac OS X.</p>

<p>This guide will cover installing a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install"><strong>ruby-install</strong></a>: a very lightweight way to install multiple Rubies on the same box.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby"><strong>chruby</strong></a>: a way to easily switch between those Ruby installs</li>
<li><strong>Ruby 2.2.3</strong>: at the time of writing the newest current stable release of Ruby.</li>
<li><strong>Bundler</strong>: a package dependency manager used in the Ruby community</li>
<li><strong>Rails 4.2.5</strong>: at the time of writing the newest current stable release of Rails.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of this guide, you will have these things installed and have some very, very easy ways to manage gem dependencies for your different applications / libraries, as well as having multiple Ruby versions installed and usable all at once.</p>

<p>We assume you have <code>sudo</code> access to your machine, and that you have an understanding of the basic concepts of Ruby, such as &quot;What is RubyGems?&quot; and more importantly &quot;How do I turn this computer-thing on?&quot;. This knowledge can be garnered by reading the first chapter of <a href="https://manning.com/black2">any Ruby book</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a good Rails book, I wrote one called <a href="http://manning.com/bigg2">Rails 4 in Action</a>.</p>

<h3>Housekeeping</h3>

<p>The first thing we&#39;re going to need to install is XCode which you can get from the Mac App Store. We&#39;ll use XCode to install the Command Line Tools which install some libraries that Ruby will use to compile itself.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">xcode-select --install
</code></pre></div>
<p>First of all, we&#39;re going to need to install some package management script so that we can install packages such as Git, MySQL and other things exceptionally easy. The best package management system on Mac OS X for this is <a href="https://brew.sh">homebrew</a>. We can install this by using this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we&#39;ll need to install <code>wget</code> because some of the commands we&#39;re about to run use it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">brew install wget
</code></pre></div>
<h3>ruby-install</h3>

<p>The installation instructions can be found <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install#install">on the README of ruby-install</a>, but I&#39;ll repeat them here so you don&#39;t have to go over there:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">wget -O ruby-install-0.5.0.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install/archive/v0.5.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ruby-install-0.5.0.tar.gz
cd ruby-install-0.5.0/
sudo make install
</code></pre></div>
<p>First we fetch the ruby-install file, extract it into a directory, then make it. You can verify that these steps have worked by running the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ruby-install -V
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you see this, then you&#39;ve successfully installed ruby-install:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby-install: 0.5.0
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Ruby</h3>

<p>Our next step is to install Ruby itself, which we can do with this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby-install ruby 2.2.3
</code></pre></div>
<p>This command will take a couple of minutes, so grab your $DRINKOFCHOICE and go outside or something. Once it&#39;s done, we&#39;ll have Ruby 2.2.3 installed. In order to use this Ruby version, we&#39;ll need to install chruby as well. The instructions <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby#install">can be found in chruby&#39;s README</a> too, but I will reproduce them here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">wget -O chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/archive/v0.3.9.tar.gz
tar -xzvf chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz
cd chruby-0.3.9/
sudo make install
</code></pre></div>
<p>After this has been installed, we&#39;ll need to load chruby automatically, which we can do by adding these lines to <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh
source /usr/local/share/chruby/auto.sh
</code></pre></div>
<p>In order for this to take effect, we&#39;ll need to source that file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">. ~/.bashrc
</code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, opening a new terminal tab/window will do the same thing.</p>

<p>To verify that chruby is installed and has detected our Ruby installation, run <code>chruby</code>. If you see this, then it&#39;s working:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby-2.2.3
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we need to make that Ruby the default Ruby for our system, which we can do by creating a new file called <code>~/.ruby-version</code> with this content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby-2.2.3
</code></pre></div>
<p>This file tells <code>chruby</code> which Ruby we want to use by default. To change the ruby version that we&#39;re using, we can run <code>chruby ruby-2.2.3</code> for example -- assuming that we have Ruby 2.2.3 installed first!</p>

<p>Did this work? Let&#39;s find out by running <code>ruby -v</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby 2.2.3p173 (2015-08-18 revision 51636) [x86_64-darwin14]
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Rails</h3>

<p>Now that we have a version of Ruby installed, we can install Rails. Because our Ruby is installed to our home directory, we don&#39;t need to use that nasty <code>sudo</code> to install things; we&#39;ve got write-access! To install the Rails gem we&#39;ll run this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">gem install rails -v 4.2.5 --no-document
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will install the <code>rails</code> gem and the multitude of gems that it and its dependencies depend on, including Bundler.</p>

<h3>MySQL</h3>

<p>Before you can use MySQL, you&#39;ll need to install it with Homebrew:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">brew install mysql
</code></pre></div>
<p>After this, <code>gem install mysql</code> should succeed.</p>

<h3>PostgreSQL</h3>

<p>Before you can use PostgreSQL, you&#39;ll need to install it with Homebrew:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">brew install postgresql
</code></pre></div>
<p>After this, <code>gem install pg</code> should succeed.</p>

<h3>Fin</h3>

<p>And that&#39;s it! Now you&#39;ve got a Ruby environment you can use to write your (first?) Rails application in with such minimal effort. A good read after this would be the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org'>official guides for Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>

<p>The combination of chruby and ruby-install is such a powerful tool and comes in handy for day-to-day Ruby development. Use it, and not the packages from apt to live a life of development luxury.</p>

<h3>Postscript</h3>

<p>A previous version of this guide used RVM. RVM has overtime become bloated and unwieldy. There are many features of RVM that developers simply don&#39;t use, and so using a simpler solution is a better way of doing things as it will lead to less confusion. For instance, RVM provides gemsets which is a feature that is no longer necessary with the advent of Bundler. Even if you don&#39;t want to use Bundler (i.e. you&#39;re crazy) then there&#39;s smaller more specifically-targeted tools for that, such as <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/ohmygems">ohmygems</a>. RVM&#39;s days as the leading way to install Ruby are over, and this guide has been updated to reflect that. There are better tools.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve opted for chruby+ruby-install in this guide because they&#39;ve consistently worked for me and are very, very easy to install. I know of a great many other people who have also used, and continue to use, these tools and I&#39;ve not heard of any of them complaining. Therefore I can only wholeheartedly recommend them to the readers of this post.</p>

   <updated>2015-04-30T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2015/04/getting-started-with-ruby-and-rails</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of people who wish to get started with Ruby and Rails, but
don&#39;t know where to start. I hope that this post will serve as a guide for
those people.</p>

<h2>Operating Systems</h2>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>People try to develop Ruby and Ruby on Rails apps on Windows and they struggle
with it. You can try developing on it, but know that it&#39;s going to be more
painful than the other options (Linux or Mac).</p>

<p>It&#39;s for this reason that I recommend installing Ubuntu in a VM
(using <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>) on your Windows PC if you&#39;re
in that environment.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu</h3>

<p>Once you&#39;ve got Ubuntu setup, you can follow my <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2014/10/ubuntu-ruby-ruby-install-chruby-and-you/">Ubuntu, Ruby, ruby-install,
chruby, Rails and You blog post</a>
which will setup a proper development environment for you on Ubuntu.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#39;t install Ruby packages from <code>apt</code></strong>. That way lies pain and suffering.</p>

<h3>Mac</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re on Mac, you can follow many of the same steps in the Ubuntu guide.
Install ruby-install, chruby as per that guide, and then you can install
<a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, and then install PostgreSQL by running this
command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">brew install postgresql
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or MySQL with this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">brew install mysql
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Getting started with Ruby</h2>

<h3>The Ruby Koans</h3>

<p><strong>FREE</strong></p>

<p>Your environment is now setup and now you&#39;re wondering where to go from here.
I <em>always</em> recommend the <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">Ruby Koans</a> which, as their
site says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn Ruby. The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and some common functions and libraries. We also teach you culture. Testing is not just something we pay lip service to, but something we live. It is essential in your quest to learn and do great things in the language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Koans are a fantastic introduction to Ruby and if I had my way, it&#39;d be

try your best. It&#39;s time I admitted: I&#39;ve never actually completed the Koans
myself. One day I might.</p>

<h3>The Well-Grounded Rubyist</h3>

<p><strong>NON-FREE</strong></p>

<p>If a book is more your style, then <a href="http://manning.com/black3">The Well-Grounded
Rubyist</a> is the one that I would recommend. The
very first version of this book (Ruby for Rails) is what I learned Ruby from.
I don&#39;t link to it here because it was out of date when I read it and that
makes it even more out of date now.</p>

<h3>Jumpstart Labs Tutorials</h3>

<p><strong>FREE</strong></p>

<p>I also recommend checking out the <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/">Jumpstart Labs
Tutorials</a>, which are written by the
people who run <a href="http://turing.io">Turing Academy</a>. These include tutorials
that will introduce you to Ruby in 100 minutes, as well as some Sinatra and
Rails tutorials so that you can wrap your head around applying Ruby to web development.</p>

<h2>Getting started with Rails</h2>

<h3>Rails 4 in Action</h3>

<p><strong>NON-FREE</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;d be remiss of me to not mention my own book, <a href="https://manning.com/bigg2">Rails 4 in
Action</a> in this section. In the book, we build a
ticket-tracking application from the ground up using Behaviour Driven
Development. Thousands of people have found it to be a great introduction to
Rails, and some people have even gotten Rails jobs after having read it.</p>

<h3>Rails Tutorial</h3>

<p><strong>FREE</strong></p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to shell out the money for my book (and why not?!), then the
free <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Rails Tutorial</a> is the next-best-thing.
In that tutorial, you build a Twitter-like application from scratch. </p>

   <title>Filtering by index in Elasticsearch</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2014/12/filtering-by-index-in-elasticsearch"/>
   <updated>2014-12-03T00:00:00+11:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2014/12/filtering-by-index-in-elasticsearch</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I needed to filter by indexes in an Elasticsearch instance, and so I googled for how to do this but I couldn&#39;t find anything other than the <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-indices-filter.html">indicies filter</a> which isn&#39;t helpful without a proper context of where to use it in a query.</p>

<p>Instead of that filter, this is what I came up with to do the filtering:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">client</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Elasticsearch</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>

   <title>Ubuntu, Ruby, ruby-install, chruby, Rails and You</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2014/10/ubuntu-ruby-ruby-install-chruby-and-you"/>
   <updated>2014-10-05T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2014/10/ubuntu-ruby-ruby-install-chruby-and-you</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Last updated: 7th December 2015</strong></p>

<p><strong>This beginner&#39;s guide will set your machine up with Ruby 2.3.0 using chruby+ruby-install and Rails 4.2.5 and is specifically written for a <em>development</em> environment on Ubuntu 14.04, but will probably work on many other operating systems, including older / newer versions of Ubuntu and Debian. YMMV.</strong></p>

<h2>Under no circumstance should you install Ruby, Rubygems or any Ruby-related packages from apt-get. This system is out-dated and leads to major headaches. Avoid it for Ruby-related packages. We do Ruby, we know what&#39;s best. Trust us.</h2>

<p>This guide will cover installing a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install"><strong>ruby-install</strong></a>: a very lightweight way to install multiple Rubies on the same box.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby"><strong>chruby</strong></a>: a way to easily switch between those Ruby installs</li>
<li><strong>Ruby 2.3.0</strong>: at the time of writing the newest current stable release of Ruby.</li>
<li><strong>Bundler</strong>: a package dependency manager used in the Ruby community</li>
<li><strong>Rails 4.2.5</strong>: at the time of writing the newest current stable release of Rails.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of this guide, you will have these things installed and have some very, very easy ways to manage gem dependencies for your different applications / libraries, as well as having multiple Ruby versions installed and usable all at once.</p>

<p>We assume you have <code>sudo</code> access to your machine, and that you have an understanding of the basic concepts of Ruby, such as &quot;What is RubyGems?&quot; and more importantly &quot;How do I turn this computer-thing on?&quot;. This knowledge can be garnered by reading the first chapter of <a href="https://manning.com/black2">any Ruby book</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a good Rails book, I wrote one called <a href="http://manning.com/bigg2">Rails 4 in Action</a>.</p>

<h3>Housekeeping</h3>

<p>First of all, we&#39;re going to run <code>sudo apt-get update</code> so that we have the latest sources on our box so that we don&#39;t run into any package-related issues, such as not being able to install some packages.</p>

<p>Next, we&#39;ll run another command which will install the essential building tools that will be used to install Ruby:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre></div>
<p>And now we&#39;re ready to install ruby-install.</p>

<h3>ruby-install</h3>

<p>The installation instructions can be found <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install#install">on the README of ruby-install</a>, but I&#39;ll repeat them here so you don&#39;t have to go over there:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">wget -O ruby-install-0.5.0.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install/archive/v0.5.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ruby-install-0.5.0.tar.gz
cd ruby-install-0.5.0/
sudo make install
</code></pre></div>
<p>First we fetch the ruby-install file, extract it into a directory, then make it. You can verify that these steps have worked by running the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ruby-install -V
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you see this, then you&#39;ve successfully installed ruby-install:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby-install: 0.5.0
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Ruby</h3>

<p>Our next step is to install Ruby itself, which we can do with this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby-install ruby 2.3.0
</code></pre></div>
<p>This command will take a couple of minutes, so grab your $DRINKOFCHOICE and go outside or something. Once it&#39;s done, we&#39;ll have Ruby 2.3.0 installed. In order to use this Ruby version, we&#39;ll need to install chruby as well. The instructions <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby#install">can be found in chruby&#39;s README</a> too, but I will reproduce them here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">wget -O chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/archive/v0.3.9.tar.gz
tar -xzvf chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz
cd chruby-0.3.9/
sudo make install
</code></pre></div>
<p>After this has been installed, we&#39;ll need to load chruby automatically, which we can do by adding these lines to your shells configuration file using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cat &gt;&gt; ~/.$(basename $SHELL)rc &lt;&lt;EOF
source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh
source /usr/local/share/chruby/auto.sh
EOF
</code></pre></div>
<p>In order for this to take effect, we&#39;ll reload the shell</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">exec $SHELL
</code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, opening a new terminal tab/window will do the same thing.</p>

<p>To verify that chruby is installed and has detected our Ruby installation, run <code>chruby</code>. If you see this, then it&#39;s working:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby-2.3.0
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we need to make that Ruby the default Ruby for our system, which we can do by creating a new file called <code>~/.ruby-version</code> with this content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby-2.3.0
</code></pre></div>
<p>This file tells <code>chruby</code> which Ruby we want to use by default. To change the ruby version that we&#39;re using, we can run <code>chruby ruby-2.3.0</code> for example -- assuming that we have Ruby 2.3.0 installed first!</p>

<p>Did this work? Let&#39;s find out by running <code>ruby -v</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby 2.3.0p0 (2015-12-25 revision 53290) [x86_64-linux]
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Rails</h3>

<p>Now that we have a version of Ruby installed, we can install Rails. Because our Ruby is installed to our home directory, we don&#39;t need to use that nasty <code>sudo</code> to install things; we&#39;ve got write-access! To install the Rails gem we&#39;ll run this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">gem install rails -v 4.2.5 --no-rdoc --no-ri
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will install the <code>rails</code> gem and the multitude of gems that it and its dependencies depend on, including Bundler.</p>

<h3>MySQL</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re planning on using the <code>mysql2</code> gem for your application then you&#39;ll want to install the <code>libmysqlclient-dev</code> package before you do that. Without it, you&#39;ll get an error when the gem tries to compile its native extensions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing mysql2:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

    /home/ryan/.rubies/ruby-2.3.0/bin/ruby extconf.rb

</code></pre></div>
<p>Install this package using <code>sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev</code>.</p>

<h3>PostgreSQL</h3>

<p>Similar to the <code>mysql2</code> gem&#39;s error above, you&#39;ll also get an error with the <code>pg</code> gem if you don&#39;t have the <code>libpq-dev</code> package installed you&#39;ll get this error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing pg:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

    /home/ryan/.rubies/ruby-2.2.0/bin/ruby extconf.rb

*** extconf.rb failed ***

libraries and/or headers.  Check the mkmf.log file for more details.  You may
need configuration options.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Install this package using <code>sudo apt-get install libpq-dev</code>.</p>

<h3>SQLite3</h3>

<p>Just like MySQL and PostgreSQL before it, attempting to install the <code>sqlite3</code> gem will result in this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

    /home/ryan/.rubies/ruby-2.2.0/bin/ruby extconf.rb
checking for sqlite3.h... no
sqlite3.h is missing. Try &#39;port install sqlite3 +universal&#39;,
&#39;yum install sqlite-devel&#39; or &#39;apt-get install libsqlite3-dev&#39;
and check your shared library search path (the
location where your sqlite3 shared library is located).
*** extconf.rb failed ***
Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary
libraries and/or headers.  Check the mkmf.log file for more details.  You may
need configuration options.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Fix this issue by running <code>sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev</code>.</p>

<h3>JavaScript Runtime</h3>

<p>Rails requires a JavaScript runtime to run its precompile step for the asset pipeline. If you attempt to run <code>rake assets:precompile</code> without one of these, you&#39;ll see this message:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable: Could not find a JavaScript runtime. See https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs for a list of available runtimes.
</code></pre></div>
<p>To fix this error install <code>nodejs</code>, which comes with a JavaScript runtime:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">sudo apt-get install nodejs
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Fin</h3>

<p>And that&#39;s it! Now you&#39;ve got a Ruby environment you can use to write your (first?) Rails application in with such minimal effort. A good read after this would be the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org'>official guides for Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>

<p>The combination of chruby and ruby-install is such a powerful tool and comes in handy for day-to-day Ruby development. Use it, and not the packages from apt to live a life of development luxury.</p>

<h3>Postscript</h3>

<p>A previous version of this guide used RVM. RVM has overtime become bloated and unwieldy. There are many features of RVM that developers simply don&#39;t use, and so using a simpler solution is a better way of doing things as it will lead to less confusion. For instance, RVM provides gemsets which is a feature that is no longer necessary with the advent of Bundler. Even if you don&#39;t want to use Bundler (i.e. you&#39;re crazy) then there&#39;s smaller more specifically-targeted tools for that, such as <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/ohmygems">ohmygems</a>. RVM&#39;s days as the leading way to install Ruby are over, and this guide has been updated to reflect that. There are better tools.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve opted for chruby+ruby-install in this guide because they&#39;ve consistently worked for me and are very, very easy to install. I know of a great many other people who have also used, and continue to use, these tools and I&#39;ve not heard of any of them complaining. Therefore I can only wholeheartedly recommend them to the readers of this post.</p>

   <title>Working Remotely</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2014/10/working-remotely"/>
   <updated>2014-10-02T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2014/10/working-remotely</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The news came out today that <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/10/01/after-raising-50m-reddit-forces-remote-workers-to-relocate-to-sf-or-get-fired/">Reddit is requiring all workers to move to San Francisco</a>. Of course, DHH (the guy who wrote <a href="http://37signals.com/remote/">a book about working remotely</a>) had an opinion about this:</p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>What a coincidence <a href="https://twitter.com/sama">@sama</a> is &quot;not a fan of remote work&quot;, <a href="https://twitter.com/yishan">@yishan</a> sought his advice on canning remoters &quot;as friend&quot;, <a href="https://t.co/Bb5yjKZ68Q">https://t.co/Bb5yjKZ68Q</a></p>&mdash; DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/517475492296151040">October 2, 2014</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I&#39;m sure telling your your kids that daddy/mommy has to uproot the family for San Fran goes down smooth once you mention Optimal Teamwork.</p>&mdash; DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/517479897808531457">October 2, 2014</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Wanting to hire the very best and insisting they all live in San Francesco is simply delusional. Far more great people outside SF than in it</p>&mdash; DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/517481377487671296">October 2, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t read DHH&#39;s book, but I agreed with him and even went as far as retweeting the last two tweets, which is unusual as I typically view DHH as person with extreme opinions and a &quot;fuck you&quot; kind of attitude that is rather grating when you&#39;re on the receiving end of it. Today though, he was spot on.</p>

<p>I worked remotely for two and a half years in my last job, wrote a book with an entirely remote team and therefore I can self-proclaim myself to be an expert on remote working. I would even go as far as to say that I&#39;ve done the best work of my life while being a remote worker. So when I hear about a company which self-proclaims itself to be &quot;The Frontpage of the Internet&quot; -- i.e. the front page of a globally distributed computer network -- moving their entire staff to San Francisco for &quot;optimal teamwork&quot;, it sounds very strange.</p>

<p>What even is &quot;optimal teamwork&quot;, anyway? You think that by magically gathering people in one building you&#39;re going to make them work any better than if they were apart? Do you think that they&#39;re going to not &quot;slack off&quot; because their boss can now come up behind them at any given moment? Do you think that they&#39;ll communicate better because they&#39;re all together?</p>

<p>No, they&#39;ll just work the same as they did before. They&#39;ll still slack off because humans aren&#39;t robots and like taking breaks every now and again from their work. It&#39;s actually provably beneficial to let people take breaks when they feel it&#39;s necessary to do so.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll be very interesting to see or hear about how bringing Reddit&#39;s team together works, or doesn&#39;t work and how many Redditors decide that the SF move is not for them.</p>

   <title>Go package management</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2014/09/go-package-management"/>
   <updated>2014-09-02T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2014/09/go-package-management</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Ruby-land, we have a wonderful tool called Bundler to manage package dependencies. I can specify dependencies like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rails&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;4.1.5&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When I run <code>bundle install</code>, Bundler will install not only the <code>rails</code> dependency, but all of its dependencies and all of their dependencies and so on. It will then take note of the dependencies which have been resolved and save them to a <code>Gemfile.lock</code>. I can commit this file to Git and push it up to GitHub, then when other people work on my project they can clone it and run <code>bundle install</code> on their machine and work with the exact same dependencies. Another benefit of this is that I can have multiple versions of Rails installed on the machine and when I use Bundler, it will use the correct version of Rails as specified in the Gemfile.</p>

<p>There&#39;s tools out there in Go-land, such as <a href="https://github.com/mattn/gom">gom</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tools/godep">godep</a> which provide similar functionality. I prefer <code>godep</code>, but truth be told I wish that there was a Bundler-for-Go. Godep saves the dependencies in a JSON file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nt">&quot;ImportPath&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;github.com/radar/my-project&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nt">&quot;GoVersion&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;go1.3&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nt">&quot;Packages&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;./...&quot;</span>
  <span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="nt">&quot;Deps&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nt">&quot;ImportPath&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;github.com/codegangsta/cli&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="nt">&quot;Comment&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;1.2.0-22-g687db20&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="nt">&quot;Rev&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;687db20fc379d1686465a28e9959707cd1acc990&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nt">&quot;ImportPath&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;github.com/fatih/color&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="nt">&quot;Rev&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;3161cccfa22c6243e02aa984cf2886d022024cec&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nt">&quot;ImportPath&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;gopkg.in/check.v1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="nt">&quot;Rev&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;5b76b26efe7f426789852e983fbde4de62c42282&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is a pretty good solution. <code>godep save</code> will update the dependencies (similar to <code>bundle update</code>), and <code>godep restore</code> will install the dependencies (similar to <code>bundle install</code>) if they aren&#39;t available in <code>GOPATH</code> already.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here&#39;s what I would like though: I want a way that I can specify dependencies for Go projects like I can specify for Ruby projects. Ruby projects have a <code>.gemspec</code> file <a href="http://git.io/teWNMw0">which lists dependencies</a>, and I would like Go projects to do the same thing. For instance, in my project I&#39;d like to specify my dependencies in a very simple JSON syntax (let&#39;s call it <code>deps.json</code>):</p>

<p>Then I would like to run a <code>bundle install</code>-equivalent which creates a <code>deps.json.lock</code>:</p>

<span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That&#39;s the first step. The second step is a lot more complex than that, and it involves fetching the dependencies from their sources and setting up a proper <code>GOPATH</code>. See, the issue with the normal <code>GOPATH</code> is that all your dependencies are thrown into the one <code>src</code> directory. This means that if you want to use &quot;Version A&quot; of a project in &quot;Codebase A&quot; and &quot;Version B&quot; of that same project in &quot;Codebase B&quot;, you&#39;re going to have a bad time. This is why I think having a <em>global</em> <code>GOPATH</code> is a terrible idea.</p>

<p>Instead, there should be a project-specific <code>GOPATH</code>. It looks the same as a normal <code>GOPATH</code>, but has the correct dependencies in it. For instance, instead of having a <code>~/Projects/go/src/github.com/radar/my-project</code>, I would have <code>~/Projects/go/my-project</code>, and then underneath that it would have <code>bin</code>, <code>pkg</code> and <code>src</code> directories relevant only to that project. The project&#39;s code itself would exist within <code>Projects/go/my-project/src/github.com/radar/my-project</code>, only because that&#39;s what Go expects.</p>

<p>To setup the project, I would create <code>~/Projects/go/my-project/src/github.com/radar/my-project</code>, and then run that <code>bundle install</code> equivalent. This would clone <code>github.com/codegangsta/cli</code> into <code>~/Projects/go/my-project/src/github.com/codegangsta/cli</code>, and check it out to the ref specified in <code>deps.json.lock</code>. It would then do the same thing with <code>github.com/fatih/color</code>. Now I have the first layer of dependencies that <code>my-project</code> needs.</p>

<p>The third step is where it gets <em>even more difficult</em>. These first layer of dependencies <em>might</em> have dependencies themselves, and so this tool should check for <code>deps.json.lock</code> (or <code>deps.json</code>) within those projects and resolve them as well. This is difficult because you may run into issues like circular dependencies and conflicting version requirements.</p>

<p>I believe if project setup was done this way, multiple Go projects on the same machine can use varying dependencies very easily.</p>

<p>There&#39;s of course caveats: potential disk usage problems, every project needs a <code>deps.json</code>, and the resolution problems. By no means am I suggesting that this is <em>The Way Things Should Be Done</em>. It&#39;s just something that occurred to me tonight that could be a potential beginning towards a solution for the Go package management puzzle.</p>

   <title>Thoughts on Go</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2014/08/thoughts-on-go"/>
   <updated>2014-08-08T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2014/08/thoughts-on-go</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve had an interest in Go now for about a year. I&#39;ve not done much with it before this week besides go through the <a href="https://github.com/cdarwin/go-koans">go-koans</a> (recommended!) and build a couple of very light projects with it, like an IRC bot that didn&#39;t do much. I&#39;ve also made a couple of commits to <a href="https://github.com/bjeanes/go-lifx">Bo Jeanes&#39; go-lifx</a> project, which is Go bindings for LIFX lights. It&#39;s still very much a work-in-progress, but it was fun to dip my toes into the Go waters again.</p>

<p>This was the first week that not only that I wrote Go code <em>for my job</em>, but I actually got to deploy it in a live production context. And it was the first week at my new job at LIFX, too. All this little program does now is read some stats from a JSON file and report them back to our analytics service. The earlier version was written in Ruby, which meant that Ruby needed to be compiled on this box just for one little script. Having the little script in Go means that we no longer need to compile Ruby on that box; a small victory but a victory nonetheless.</p>

<p>I dislike that I don&#39;t know much about Go still at this stage. That probably boils down to me not really having a proper use for it until recent. It could also be because a lot of the Go documentation out there is similar to a cookbook that only explains the properties of the ingredients, rather than having recipes. I enjoy learning by example and I think other people do also, because they bought <a href="https://manning.com/bigg2">a book that I wrote</a> that&#39;s all about the examples.</p>

<p>I like that the Go packages themselves are pretty well-documented. I especially like that I know what <em>type</em> of object I&#39;m supposed to be passing in. Take <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/time/#Unix"><code>time.Unix</code></a> for example. It works similarly to <code>Time.at(unix_time)</code> in Ruby. The Go documentation for <code>time.Unix</code> clearly indicates that it takes two arguments, both of which are of the <code>int64</code> type, and that it returns a Time &quot;instance&quot;. That&#39;s something that I didn&#39;t think I would like, given that I&#39;ve been doing Ruby for so long and it has a little thing called duck-typing where methods can be defined on anything and everything. A Ruby motto could perhaps be: &quot;If it quacks like a duck, let&#39;s pretend it is a duck for fear of finding out what it truly is.&quot; In Ruby, methods can return whatever they want and more often than not, to know what a method returns you have to look at how that method is defined. Oh, and in Go methods can return multiple values, like <code>json.Marshal</code> (like <code>to_json</code> in Ruby) which will return the marshalled JSON (as an array of bytes) as well as (possibly) an error if that marshalling fails for some reason.</p>

<p>I like that you can compile your program down to a binary file very easily and then deploy it to a server. For instance, on the <code>go-lifx</code> project, we can (and do) provide some very simple binaries that are compiled from the code within that project using Go&#39;s built-in tool: <code>go build</code>. </p>

<p>I also enjoy the <code>go get</code> tool. It took me a while to figure out that if I structured my <code>~/Projects/go</code> directory properly, that my Go experience would be more fluid. The proper way to structure it is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Projects/go
  -&gt; src
    -&gt; github.com
      -&gt; bjeanes
        -&gt; go-lifx
</code></pre></div>
<p>I&#39;ve set <code>GOPATH</code> to <code>~/Projects/go</code> and so then when I type <code>go get github.com/codegangsta/cli</code> it will install it into <code>~/Projects/go/src/github.com/codegangsta/cli</code>. I can then reference it in my Go program very simply:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">import (
  &quot;github.com/codegangsta/cli&quot;
)
</code></pre></div>
<p>That way, if I want to use it in another project then I can do it in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>Finally, the <code>go fmt</code> tool is the tool to end all (most?) coding syntax debates. It enforces tab-indentation, and blank spaces for alignment. It does a couple more things, which are <a href="http://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">explained in gofmt&#39;s documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoy the language and look forward to learning more about it, as well as finding other situations where we can use it at LIFX.</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, the <a href="http://spreecommerce.com/blog/farewell-ryan-bigg">rumours are true</a>, I am leaving Spree Commerce. This makes me a git because there&#39;s one and only one Community Manager at Spree, and so that void will need to be filled by someone else. Thankfully Jeff Dutil is going to step into my role as interim Community Manager for the time being.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also a git for tricking you all:</p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<hr>

<p>I&#39;m not going to work for GitHub. I&#39;m going to work at <a href="http://lifx.co">LIFX</a> as a Ruby programmer there, starting August 4th. It was exceptionally lonely working in this Melbourne timezone mostly by myself, and I was getting complacent at Spree. I want a bigger challenge while I still have the time and energy for it. </p>

<p>LIFX seems like a perfect fit in regards to those things. I&#39;ll be working with people in an office in Richmond (not far from where I currently work at <a href="http://inspire9.com.au">Inspire9</a>), and the work will be something different to the ecommerce work that I&#39;ve been doing for 2.5 years. The Internet of Things is a really neat concept and I am really looking forward to working at LIFX.</p>

<hr>

<p>I first worked with Spree when I worked with my old job building the <a href="https://shop.abc.net.au/">ABC online store</a>. I was also working on the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html">Engines Guide</a> at this point, so my interest around Rails engines was still quite intense. </p>

<p>Josh Adams pinged me about <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/spree-user/P0iywDQokto">a discussion regarding namespaces on the spree user mailing list</a> and I just <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/spree-user/P0iywDQokto/jhtAftv7RK8J">had to reply</a>. That week, Sean from Spree messaged me over IRC and asked if I wanted a job. A month later I started working there on the namespacing work and gradually took over the maintenance of the project from Sean and Brian while they worked on developing Spree Commerce as a business.</p>

<p>As a result of that, I&#39;ve made <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/graphs/contributors">over 3000 commits</a> and posted 7,000 issue comments. Over two and a half years, that averages out to 3 commits per day and almost 8 comments. I&#39;ve also posted 15,000 messages in the Spree IRC channel. I don&#39;t know the email stats, but I would guess it falls within the same range. I apologise for all the spam.</p>

<p>I&#39;m immensely proud of my work at Spree. It&#39;s been an interesting challenge to work on building something as complex as an ecommerce platform and still keeping it neat and tidy in comparison to certain other ecommerce frameworks. I know the Spree team will keep up the great work that they&#39;ve been doing on Wombat. The future of Spree is looking bright, and I wish them all the best.</p>

<hr>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;d like to thank Matt Allen from <a href="http://lookahead.com.au">Lookahead Search</a> for talking with me about this decision and other jobs. There&#39;s quite a lot of jobs out there (for someone with my supposed talents) and it was hard making the decision between the places that I had talked to during my job hunt. Matt is extremely patient and a good friend and I appreciate his help a ton.</p>

   <title>Initial thoughts on Lotus</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2014/06/initial-thoughts-on-lotus"/>
   <updated>2014-06-19T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2014/06/initial-thoughts-on-lotus</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following on from my <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2014/06/spree-factories-and-callbacks/">last post</a>, I&#39;ve been experimenting some more with my <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree_poro">spree_poro</a>, and I&#39;ve been looking at how to work with some kind of data store persistence more sophisticated than the <code>Spree::Data</code> constant that I had used previously. I wanted something more sophisticated than running <code>select</code>s over arrays.</p>

<p><a href="http://lotusrb.org">Lotus</a> bills itself as a &quot;complete web framework for Ruby&quot; and also uses the words &quot;simple&quot;, &quot;fast&quot;, and &quot;lightweight&quot;. In my limited experience of only using the <code>Lotus::Model</code> part of the framework, I can say it&#39;s all of those things. <code>Lotus::Model</code> itself is less than 600 lines and my tests (now 50 of them) still run in &lt;0.05 seconds.</p>

<p><code>Lotus::Model</code> departs from the ActiveRecord way of doing things by having four main types of objects: entities, mappers, repositories and adapters. The creator of Lotus (Luca Guida) has <a href="http://lucaguidi.com/2014/04/23/introducing-lotus-model.html">a great post outlining what each of those do</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve added <code>Lotus::Model</code> to spree_poro (in a <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree_poro/tree/lotus">new branch</a>) and I have it persisting zones, tax rates, tax categories and products; not to a database but to memory. It would be very easy for me to switch this over to an SQL database, thanks to how Lotus is designed. </p>

<p>Having the entities separate from the persistence code means there&#39;s a clear separation between the business logic of the entities and the persistence logic of the repositories. If I want to test that finding tax rates based on an order&#39;s tax zone works, I no longer test that on the <code>Spree::TaxRate</code> model. Instead, that responsibility falls to the <code>Spree::TaxRateRepository</code>, and so <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree_poro/blob/fac4921d87c6a047e8b2df380137f3866cac2442/spec/spree/repositories/tax_rate_spec.rb">that is where it&#39;s tested</a>. This means that I could even get away with stubbing <code>Spree::TaxRateRepository.match</code> in the normal <code>TaxRate</code> specs to return some plain Ruby objects, and those tests do not need to care about any persistence layer at all.</p>

<p>I am very interested to see how this whole Lotus thing pans out. It&#39;s very easy to understand at this point in time, other than that I can&#39;t work out how to properly do polymorphic associations (as is necessary for promotions within Spree, sadly). Perhaps that would be a feature that comes eventually to Lotus, or we re-architect the way Spree is designed to work more with Lotus.</p>

   <title>Spree, Factories and Callbacks</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2014/06/spree-factories-and-callbacks"/>
   <updated>2014-06-17T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2014/06/spree-factories-and-callbacks</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During last week, I was trying to wrap my head around Spree&#39;s code again. I continued my efforts yesterday and tweeted this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Realtalk: I think we’ve dug ourselves a nice hole in Spree by relying too much on callbacks + Factory Girl factories.</p>&mdash; The Bigg Man Himself (@ryanbigg) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbigg/statuses/478316786576674816">June 15, 2014</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Some people have asked me to explain what I mean by this, and hopefully I can do that in this blog post. </p>

<p>Spree is a pretty complex chunk of code which has been built up over the past 6 years and it&#39;s always been based off &quot;the Rails way&quot; of doing things. Being a Rails developer myself, I enjoy this because the design of Spree is not dissimilar to any other Rails app that I worked on before coming to work on Spree full time. The models in both Rails apps and Spree itself are in <code>app/models</code>, and the controllers are in <code>app/controllers</code> and so on.</p>

<p>A lot of people have come to disagree with the general way that Rails applications are designed. Just look around the internet and you&#39;ll see talks like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGN4RFkhH2M&amp;feature=kp">Matt Wynne&#39;s &quot;Hexagonal Rails&quot;</a> and <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years">Uncle Bob Martin&#39;s &quot;Architecture the Lost Years&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>You would think that I would generally agree with the way Rails apps and Spree are architected, given that I <a href="https://manning.com/bigg2">wrote a book</a> about Rails and I am the <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/graphs/contributors">#1 committer to Spree</a>.</p>

<p>You&#39;d be <em>mostly</em> right. I&#39;m familiar with it all, and so I like. There&#39;s still a lot to be desired, however.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to find the architecture of Rails ties it all too closely together. Take for example <a href="https://gist.github.com/radar/00e321fb4be0c20666aa">this Gist of SQL, generated from when Spree creates a line item from a factory</a>. SQL like this is generated at the top of the test <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/4687e608b49236c2850500b026a9fbbab37dc96c/core/spec/models/spree/calculator/default_tax_spec.rb">within <code>spec/models/spree/calculator/default_tax_spec.rb</code></a>. This SQL is a result of an abuse of factories on one hand, and quite a large amount of callbacks within Spree itself. There is no reason other than convenience that these factories are used; they create all the other &quot;necessary&quot; objects for our test, and sometimes even unnecessary ones. </p>

<p>Just by creating that one line item, the test file has inserted 20 records into the database, and has issued 34 <code>UPDATE</code> commands. I have no clue as to how many of those are required.</p>

<p>Sure, the factories provide some good. For instance, the line item factory creates a variant, which creates a product, and a product has a tax category. From the line item&#39;s variant&#39;s product&#39;s tax category, we can work out how much tax this line item is supposed to incur.</p>

<p>If you look through the code for this spec, there&#39;s not a single place where database persistence is necessary. All this test needs to do is to take some items and, based off the tax rates available, calculate the correct amounts.</p>

<p>Why does this test need to add data to the database and then read it? Couldn&#39;t the whole code of this be done with plain old Ruby objects and the persistence left to something else?</p>

<h2>PORO Spree</h2>

<p>The answer to that is yes. I&#39;ve done just that in my <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree_poro">spree_poro</a> project. I&#39;ve cheated a little by passing around a <code>Spree::Data</code> constant rather than using something more responsible like the Repository Pattern (<a href="https://twitter.com/sj26/status/478462521343348737">hat-tip to @sj26</a>), but the whole idea is there.</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree_poro/blob/master/spec/spree/tax_rate_spec.rb">TaxRate spec file</a>. Rather than factories, all the information is setup in the test. It&#39;s all Plain Old Ruby Objects. It does nothing with the &quot;database&quot;, other than that <code>Spree::Data</code> cheat I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Oh, and it&#39;s fast. It runs 52 examples in 0.08 seconds. From start to finish, I get test feedback in about 1.5 seconds, which perfectly suits my short attention span.</p>

<h2>Callbacks</h2>

<p>Besides the callback hooks that live in <code>Spree::ItemAdjustments</code> that allow people to hook into the adjustment cycle within Spree, there&#39;s no other callbacks within the <code>spree_poro</code> system. It is my honest belief that we should be able to do everything that Spree does already in this small, enclosed system, sans factories and sans callbacks.</p>

<p>Within Spree-proper, there&#39;s a lot of callbacks. Take this chain of events that happens when an adjustment is created from a promotion:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/4687e608b49236c2850500b026a9fbbab37dc96c/core/app/models/spree/promotion/actions/create_item_adjustments.rb#L32">create_adjustment is called</a>, which instantly persists an Adjustment object to the database.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/4687e608b49236c2850500b026a9fbbab37dc96c/core/app/models/spree/adjustment.rb#L42"><code>update_adjustable_adjustment_total</code> is called</a>, which <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/4687e608b49236c2850500b026a9fbbab37dc96c/core/app/models/spree/adjustment.rb#L101-L104">calls out to one of the POROs already within Spree</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/4687e608b49236c2850500b026a9fbbab37dc96c/core/app/models/spree/item_adjustments.rb#L38-L45">Spree::ItemAdjustments#update_adjustments</a> fetches all the promotional adjustments for the object <em>from the database</em>, and calls <code>Spree::Adjustment#update!</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/4687e608b49236c2850500b026a9fbbab37dc96c/core/app/models/spree/adjustment.rb#L84-L97">Spree::Adjustment#update!</a> computes the adjustment&#39;s value based on the source&#39;s (promotion action&#39;s) calculator, and then <em>saves that to the database</em>. If it&#39;s a promotion, it&#39;ll <em>save again</em> by updating the eligibility of the promotion (which is a <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/4687e608b49236c2850500b026a9fbbab37dc96c/core/app/models/spree/promotion.rb#L72-L75">whole other rabbit hole</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>I really think this could be all improved by having an <code>Order</code> object in-memory and acting upon that. The <code>Adjustment</code> objects would be on the in-memory <code>Order</code> object now, much like they are in <code>spree_poro</code>. Any changes to that object are persisted back to the database much later on. It&#39;s not the code&#39;s job to care about these changes getting back to the database. It&#39;s the code&#39;s job to perform these calculations and return us a result. Some <em>other</em> code needs to take care of persisting it back to the database.</p>

<p>This is why I think Rails apps are &quot;tied too closely together&quot;. We have the &quot;model&quot; which is this thing which contains <em>both</em> the business logic and the persistence logic. They should&#39;ve been separate concerns from the beginning. Having the one class that can do both things has lead us down this trap.</p>

<p>If I was going to re-architect Spree -- or any large Rails app for that matter -- something like <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree_poro">spree_poro</a> is where I would start. I wouldn&#39;t start with a Rails app, or even a Rails engine. I would start here: in a small repo of code that has tests written before any code, then the code implements the business rules and the tests pass. Refactoring happens then, because otherwise <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/radar/spree_poro">CodeClimate</a> would say nasty things about the code. The Rails engine can call out to it later.</p>

   <title>Community Management</title>

   <updated>2014-04-02T00:00:00+11:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2014/04/community-management</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve been the &quot;Community Manager&quot; for Spree for a couple of years now. It&#39;s a
job where I answer user support requests wherever they happen: IM, email, IRC,
Stack Overflow. I&#39;ve been splitting this up with some development on Spree,
building features like the new adjustments system whilst getting some great
feedback about them from the community.</p>

<p>Over time, it&#39;s been getting busier and busier and I&#39;ve ended up doing more
&quot;community management&quot; and less programming and it&#39;s been burning me out. When
I&#39;m programming, I know that I&#39;m working towards a goal. When I&#39;m answering
emails, there&#39;s always more emails to answer the next day. It just doesn&#39;t
feel like progress is happening at all.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve just passed our busiest time of the year. People have found Spree and
want to either start using it, or port over from their existing ecommerce
platform. These people generally start asking questions at the end of January
and it quietens down around about now, picking up slightly in June (I don&#39;t
know why, it just does) and the later months of the year due to Black Friday /
Christmas / people wanting things done &quot;Right Now Or Else&quot; by the end of the
year.</p>

<p>During this extremely busy phase, I&#39;ve really dialed back on the programming
part of my job and I&#39;ve been dedicating most of my time to answering user
support requests, mainly in the form of trying to keep my email inbox at an
amount as close to zero as possible. The community benefits from this work
because those people asking the questions get the support they need and they
can continue on doing their own things. That&#39;s a great thing. When people are
using something that I helped build <em>and they like using it</em>; that is one of
the best feelings in the world. It&#39;s part of the reason why I&#39;ve stayed here
in this job longer than any other job I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s also a pretty awesome
team to work with.</p>

<p>After SpreeConf (26-27th Feb), I did an email inbox cull and still had 500+
emails to read through and reply to. This is part of my job, and it seemed
overwhelming. I was occassionally grumpy and short with my words. It&#39;s only
last week -- <em>a whole month later</em> -- that I was able to get this inbox number
down to less than 50. As I write this now, it sits at almost 200.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s a legitimate reason for that. For the past two days I&#39;ve been
doing exclusively programming work. I closed Airmail and worked for two days
in Sublime Text, iTerm and Chrome. It felt <em>glorious</em>. It felt like <em>progress</em>.</p>

<p>Last Friday at approximately 4:40pm my time and ridiculous o&#39; clock (1:40am) in DC,
Sean passed on a message from one of our clients who said something to the
effect that Magento&#39;s order interface in the admin backend was better than
Spree&#39;s order interface. Now, there&#39;s not many things Magento is better at
than Spree, but this is (supposedly) one of them. I agreed whole-heartedly with the
message, but it was 4:40pm on a Friday and I was thinking/dreaming of the
weekend.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve personally been wanting to change the admin backend for quite a while. It
doesn&#39;t adjust itself depending on the order&#39;s checkout steps, which is a
feature that we implemented about 6 major Spree releases. It just hasn&#39;t been
that important to work on as other things have been.</p>

<p>This little comment ate at me all weekend. How could we be <em>worse</em> than
Magento at something? Was that even possible? Yes, it was. The order interface
reloaded the entire page after every single change and it was infuriating. It
felt sluggish. Creating an order in Spree&#39;s admin backend shouldn&#39;t be
tedious, it should be <em>fast</em>.</p>

<p><a href='http://ryanbigg.com/videos/old_admin.mov'>Here&#39;s a video of the admin order interface</a></p>

<p>So on Monday I worked on improving this. I rewrote templates from ERB to
Underscore templates. I converted some JavaScript code that was defining top-
level functions into some CoffeeScript+Backbone code that defined those
functions as proper events within Backbone views.</p>

<p>I made it fast. <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/videos/new_admin.mov'>Here&#39;s a video of the new admin order interface</a></p>

<p>This felt like progress, because it is progress. I&#39;m improving something
within Spree rather than answering emails, and I feel really good about it.</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m going to be doing now is devoting at least a day a week to purely
coding on Spree. All the emails can wait an extra day. Hopefully those emails
will be answered by someone else.</p>

<p>You can see the code for these recent changes over on <a href='https://github.com/radar/spree/tree/new-order-interface'>my new-order-interface branch</a>.</p>

   <title>Violence in the Ruby community</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2013/10/violence-in-the-ruby-community"/>
   <updated>2013-10-14T00:00:00+11:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2013/10/violence-in-the-ruby-community</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post was written by myself and my fiancee,
<a href="https://twitter.com/smly_law">Sharon</a>, about the alleged sexual assault of Justine
Arreche by Joe O&#39;Brien at Codemash 2013. Both Joe and Justine are, like me,
members of the Ruby community. Sharon is a lawyer who&#39;s currently supporting
domestic violence victims in her work, and feels that domestic violence and
other violent acts against women are symptomatic of a lack of respect towards
women by men. Misogyny, basically.</p>

<p>I read out <a href="http://blogjustine.wordpress.com/2013/10/12%0A/because-it-needs-to-be-said/">Justine&#39;s post</a> to Sharon over the weekend; she was driving at
the time. I also told her that there&#39;s <em>at least</em> one sexual assault in the
tech community every two months, and that the statistic is probably higher
because a lot of them probably go unreported. She was shocked but said that a
lot of violent crimes perpetrated against women do go unreported. Often the
perpetrator is known to the victim, and this is largely one of the reasons
that crimes don&#39;t get reported. Sometimes it&#39;s a breakdown in trust and
there&#39;s so much confusion on the part of the victim about what&#39;s happened, who
did it, and how to react to it.</p>

<p>Justine&#39;s post is evidence of all of these things. She questioned her own
judgments, she apportioned blame to herself for a crime that was committed
against her and she didn&#39;t feel she could speak out about it. It wasn&#39;t until
long after (9 months) the act had been committed, did she appear to feel she
was safe to talk about it. By that stage, the perpetrator (Joe), had well and
truly gotten away with the act, it seems.</p>

<p>Justine expresses in her post, something that Sharon sees every day in her
work. A woman who feels that she has been the only one to have worn the cost
of what someone else has done to her. What someone else <em>chose</em> to do to her.</p>

<p>In Australia, any sexual assault is a crime. A workplace should not cover this
up. Any investigation into this sort of matter should include the police and
charges should be laid against the perpetrator. Joe needs to be held to
account for his actions in a court of law and Justine should be entitled to
that kind of justice. She even says herself in her post that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want him to recognize the toll he&#39;s taken on my life and how everything
 has changed for me. How he took so much of myself away from how I used to
 be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not clear from Justine&#39;s post whether any legal action has happened. We
certainly hope it has. As it stands already, he has committed career suicide
for himself by doing this, and worst of all has affected someone else&#39;s
potential career. Not to mention the flow on effects of all this as well.
Justine became withdrawn from her colleagues, her family, broken up with her
boyfriend and still struggles with day-to-day life. No woman anywhere in the
world should feel this threatened. Especially in a community which has the
mantra &quot;Matz is nice, so we are nice&quot;.</p>

<p>Sharon is appalled to learn that women feel this threatened in the Ruby
community. The Ruby community is one that is partly professional, and partly
social. To me, Ruby has been like a third family for the past 8 years. Sharon
knows how much the Ruby community means to me. I love it to bits, more than
because it pays the bills. Programming is something I enjoy doing and I enjoy
attending conferences because I don&#39;t feel threatened there. When I hear about
other people attending conferences and feeling threatened in any way by
anyone, it makes me feel like I don&#39;t want to do those things anymore.</p>

<p>In any professional community, there is no place for sexual violence. Sharon
wonders what it is that makes a community accept violence in any way and
suspects its because people don&#39;t stand against it when it happens on a small
scale. There&#39;s a saying that Sharon really likes: &quot;From little things, big
things grow&quot;. If there is a little violence, you can sure bet that big
violence will be on its way.</p>

<p>What does this mean practically in the Ruby community? We think, that like any
other community, if small things are said or done or encouraged, whether the
people are intoxicated or not, it breaks down people&#39;s sensitivity towards
those things. We think that encouraging a woman to do bodyshots at a
professional conference is a small thing that perpetrates violence against
that woman. It is an act of disrespect to that woman as a human being and a
professional. Why didn&#39;t the other men in the bar discourage her from doing
that? Or discourage other people from insisting that she do that? Would you
encourage a man in the community to do that? If not, then why would you
encourage a woman? Show some respect.</p>

<p>In Australia, we have <a href="http://www.whiteribbon.org.au/">White Ribbon Day</a>,
which is a male-led movement to end violence against women. This movement aims
to encourage men to <em>never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence
against women.</em> Sharon and I support the Ruby community thinking about this
theology and applying it seeing as the Ruby community is predominantly male
and wants to attract more women programmers. Sharon has some pretty strong
thoughts on this, extending to other industries as well.</p>

<p>The Ruby community should make the space for women to feel comfortable and
that includes making effort to discourage disrespectful behaviour, thoughts
and conversations about women. Men generally, but specifically the Ruby
community, need to start seeing women not as objects for their own
gratification or pleasure, but as other human beings who have thoughts, who
can make a valuable contribution to the community -- see women like Sandi Metz
and Sarah Mei. Women are human beings, equal in every way.</p>

<p>If you see any act of violence committed against any member of this community
or others: please speak up about it. Go over to them and ask if everyone&#39;s OK.
That&#39;s sometimes all people need. If you can&#39;t go there, talk to someone else
about it. The worst thing you can do is to stay silent about it.</p>

<p>This culture of men thinking that it&#39;s ok to make those comments and to act
that way towards women, has to be stopped.</p>

   <title>Order adjustments within Spree</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2013/09/order-adjustments"/>
   <updated>2013-09-24T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2013/09/order-adjustments</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When buying anything these days, there are a lot of different offers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Order more than $100 and get 10% off your order.</li>
<li>Buy a specific number of products and get free shipping for your entire order.</li>
<li>Buy 1 product, get 1 of the same product free.</li>
<li>10% off t-shirts this week!</li>
</ul>

<p>And many, many more. While it is easy for people&#39;s minds to understand,
modelling these promotion rules and actions within code so that the computer&#39;s
&quot;mind&quot; understands too, is somewhat difficult.</p>

<p>Alongside this are other potential order adjustments, both manual and
automatic. On the manual side of things, you may have a requirement to give
10% off to an order because the customer fit some kind of pre-defined
requirement for that to happen; a store credit or whatever. On the automatic
side of things, taxation rears its ugly head(s).</p>

<p>What follows is an in-depth description of how <a href="http://spreecommerce.com">Spree</a> is organised to deal with these situations.</p>

<h2>The lay of the land</h2>

<p>To help us along for this problem within Spree we have a couple of entities: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Orders</strong>: Track a collection of items that a user has added to their cart and is probably going to purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Line Items</strong>: A list of the items, attached to the order itself. Worth noting is that these records cache the price of the product at the moment they&#39;re added to the order, to protect against price fluctuation.</li>
<li><strong>Shipments</strong>: Groups of items that are being shipped, grouped typically by stock location but can also be grouped by availability. For example, a shirt you bought may be available to be shipped today, but the pants you bought also are on backorder and can&#39;t be shipped immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Adjustments</strong>: Used to track any adjustment to any of the above items. Adjustments have a source which is the entity which triggered this adjustment and a link to the thing being adjusted, called the &quot;adjustable&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p>These four entities are the foundations of the adjustments system within Spree.</p>

<h2>Calculation of an order&#39;s total, without tax</h2>

<p>Calculating an order&#39;s final total is made complex by the possible adjustments on each line item or shipment within an order, as well as possible adjustments on the order itself. To calculate an order&#39;s final total, we take each line item minus its discounts and plus its taxes, each of its shipments minus their discounts and plus their taxes, then minus the order&#39;s adjustments and then we have a final total.</p>

<p>A good demonstration of this would be an order such as this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Line Item #1: $50 shirt with an adjustment that decreases the price by $10.</li>
<li>Line Item #2: $150 pants with no adjustment.</li>
<li>Shipment #1: Containing just the shirt. Would normally be $5, but with a &quot;Free shipping&quot; adjustment applied, is actually $0.</li>
<li>Shipment #2: Containing just the shirt. Shipping is $10 for this.</li>
<li>Order adjustment of $20 off, due to gift card usage.</li>
</ul>

<p>First, we sum the line items and their adjustments, which would be this equation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">($50 - $10) + $50 = $90
</code></pre></div>
<p>The order&#39;s total so far is $90. Now we add the shipments:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">($5 - $5) + $10 = $10
</code></pre></div>
<p>We add this number to the line items&#39; total and we get $100. Now we apply the order&#39;s adjustments to this subtotal amount:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$100 - $20 = $80
</code></pre></div>
<p>This results in the order&#39;s grand total of $80.</p>

<p>The situation is slightly more complex when you bring in tax to the equation.</p>

<h2>Calculation of an order&#39;s total, with tax</h2>

<p>Now let&#39;s assume the same situation, but now we have tax adjustments to apply to the different parts of the order too. Let&#39;s say in this instance that the line items and the shipment also have a 10% tax charge.</p>

<p>With the same scenario as before:</p>

<ul>
<li>Line Item #1: $50 shirt with an adjustment that decreases the price by $10.</li>
<li>Line Item #2: $50 pants with no adjustment.</li>
<li>Shipment #1: Containing just the shirt. Would normally be $5, but with a &quot;Free shipping&quot; adjustment applied, is actually $0.</li>
<li>Shipment #2: Containing just the pants. Shipping is $10 for this.</li>
<li>Order adjustment of $20 off, due to gift card usage.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first line item&#39;s total would be calculated like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">($50 - $10) = $40 + (10% of $40) = $44
($40)       =        $40 + $4    = $44
</code></pre></div>
<p>Worth noting here is that the discount is applied first, <em>then</em> the tax rate. This is the most sensible option because if someone is purchasing an item with the intention of receiving that $10 off, it is more intuitive that the $10 is off the listing price, rather than the after-tax price. This is also the recommended behavior, as mentioned later in the &quot;Promotions and Tax&quot; section.</p>

<p>The second line item would be calculated in roughly the same way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">($50 + (10% of $50) = $55
($50 + $5)          = $55
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that in these situations we are calculating the adjustment amount (if it exists) and then the tax amount. The buyer of a product should only be taxed on the final adjusted price of the line item, rather than its base price. In the instance of the first line item, the base price is $40 rather than $50 due to do the -$10 adjustment. Therefore the tax for this item would be 10% of $40 ($4), rather than 10% of $50 ($5).</p>

<p>Therefore the order&#39;s total so far is <code>$44 + $55</code>, $99. Now to calculate the shipments, it would be this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">       (Shipment #1)              (Shipment #2)
($5 - $5) = $0 + (10% of $0)  +  $10 + (10% of $10) = $0 + $11 = $11
</code></pre></div>
<p>Because the first shipment has a &quot;free shipping&quot; adjustment, there is no additional tax adjustment to this shipment.</p>

<p>That means that the order&#39;s subtotal, with line items of $99 and shipments of $11, would be $110. The order&#39;s adjustment of $20 off, means the order&#39;s grand total is $90.</p>

<h2>Calculation of an order&#39;s total, with tax included in the price</h2>

<p>To further complicate matters, tax can also be <em>included</em> in the price, rather than being an additional cost applied.</p>

<p>In Australia, there is a GST (Goods and Services Tax) applied to some items. This tax is a flat 10% and is included in the price of those items. An item that is worth $50 would have $4.545... of that amount made up by GST. The calculation is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$50 - ($50 / 110%) = $4.54545...
</code></pre></div>
<p>This tax amount <em>must</em> be displayed on receipts (and similar) because stores need it for end of financial year taxation purposes, and so this is what Spree refers to as an &quot;included&quot; adjustment, which is an adjustment which will not modify the total price. Within Spree, an item that is $50 will have a $4.545... adjustment applied to it, but that item will still cost $50.</p>

<p>To <em>even further</em> complicate matters, tax that is included in an item&#39;s price must be backed out in certain circumstances. For example, an item with a 10% VAT tax sold in a European country to a buyer outside of that country must have that 10% tax refunded.</p>

<p>Taking again the example a single line item that costs $50, with 10% of that price being this 10% VAT tax. When this item is sold to someone outside the VAT zone, we must apply a negative adjustment to the line item to refund that tax. The calculation for the adjustment is the same as before:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$50 - ($50 / 110%) = $4.54545...
</code></pre></div>
<p>The adjustment is rounded up to the second decimal point, which will result in an adjustment of $4.55, rather than $4.54.</p>

<p>This means that the adjusted price for the line item will be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$50 - $4.55 = $45.45
</code></pre></div>
<p>If this item has a discount adjustment, then that discount is applied before the tax adjustment. Let&#39;s say that we have the $50 item with a $10 discount, and a tax rate of 10%. The calculation is then:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">($50 - $10) - ($40 / 110%) = $3.6363636...
</code></pre></div>
<p>With the adjustment, the sale price of the item would only be $40, therefore the tax subtraction for this item will be $3.63, rather than the original $4.55.</p>

<h2>Tax adjustments within Spree</h2>

<h3>The Theory</h3>

<p>Tax adjustment calculation within current versions of Spree calculates the sum of all tax amounts for the line items and apply this total as a singular adjustment to the order. Shipments are currently not taxed.</p>

<p>Future versions of Spree will apply adjustments on a per-item basis; both line items and shipments will receive their own tax adjustments. </p>

<p>Due to there not being one global tax rate, the only logical places to intially calculate the tax necessary for line items and shipments are after a user enters their address information, and then once more directly before they are asked to pay for the order.</p>

<p>The reasons for this are really simple: it&#39;s impossible to know what a person&#39;s tax rate is going to be before they have told us what their address is. Once we have that information, we can fairly accurately calculate the tax for all items within the order. Recalculating it once again before they pay for the order ensures that the adjustment amounts are correct.</p>

<p>(Aside: for a demonstration about how much exactly tax rates can differ, click around a couple of times on <a href="https://taxcloud.net/find-a-rate/default.aspx">this map</a> within any one state. This service is what the <a href="https://github.com/bluehandtalking/spree_tax_cloud">Spree Tax Cloud extension</a> uses.)</p>

<p>With adjustment information stored on a per-line item basis, it is now relatively easy to update a tax adjustment for a line item if that line item changes. Take for example our previous example of the $50 shirt with the 10% tax, but no other adjustment yet. To calculate that line item&#39;s tax, the calculation is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$50 + (10% of $50) = $55
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now imagine that instead of 1 shirt, the buyer is actually buying 2. The calculation would only be this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">($50 * 2) + (10% of $100) = $110
</code></pre></div>
<p>In previous versions of Spree, having one tax adjustment for the entire order makes things complex, because this tax adjustment would need to be recalculated for <em>all</em> line items, rather than just the one that has changed.</p>

<p>By applying adjustments on a per-item basis -- as opposed to one adjustment for the entire order -- we also gain the ability to refund a product&#39;s price quickly and efficiently. Refunding a product is now as simple as calculating a line item&#39;s product price, plus any of its adjustments.</p>

<p>If an adjustment is applied to the order as a whole, we would need to calculate how much of that adjustment is for that particular item, refund the product&#39;s price (minus any adjustments) and then re-save the adjustment total for the order. This process -- just like the process described earlier of altering the quantity of a line item -- is computationally expensive.</p>

<h3>In Practice: Adjustment Creation</h3>

<p>Tax adjustments within Spree are not applied until after we have the buyer&#39;s address. Once we have their address, then we can go back through the order and apply the tax adjustments to the line items. This event is triggered by a <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/order/checkout.rb#L74-L76">state machine callback within <code>Spree::Order::Checkout</code></a>. The <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/order.rb#L278-L281"><code>create_tax_charge!</code> method</a> calls out to <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/tax_rate.rb#L35-L39">the <code>Spree::TaxRate.adjust</code> method</a>.</p>

<p>This method checks which tax rates match the order&#39;s tax zone. The tax zone for the order is determined either by the order&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/order.rb#L187-L189">tax_address</a> (either its shipping or billing address, depending on the <code>Spree::Config[:tax_using_ship_address]</code>). If <code>Zone.match</code> does not return <code>true</code> in that case, it uses the default tax zone, if there is one. </p>

<p>If this method does not return a zone, then <code>Spree::TaxRate.match</code> returns nothing and no adjustments are applied to the order.</p>

<p>If the method does return a zone, then <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/tax_rate.rb#L27-L33"><code>Spree::TaxRate.match</code></a> goes through and checks every single tax rate against the order itself. The tax rates returned from this method are then <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/tax_rate.rb#L55-L69">applied to each item</a> that was passed in to <code>Spree::TaxRate.adjust</code> from <code>Spree::Order#create_tax_charge!</code>. The tax rates are compared with the items they&#39;re adjusting in the <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/calculator/default_tax.rb"><code>Spree::Calculator::DefaultTax</code> calculator</a>. If the line item or shipment&#39;s tax category (inferred from the product&#39;s tax category) matches the tax category of the product, then an adjustment will be applied.</p>

<p>In this particular case of the state machine callback for transitioning out of the <code>address</code> state, it is <em>all</em> the line items and <em>all</em> the shipments which have their tax calculated. This same calculation of the tax rates for all line items and all shipments <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/order/checkout.rb#L83-L86">also takes place once the order transitions to the payment step</a>.</p>

<p>The only additional place where tax adjustments are automatically created is within the <code>LineItem</code> model, as an <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/line_item.rb#L106-L108"><code>after_create</code> callback</a>. This callback is necessary because if an order is created and has already transitioned past the address state, the tax rate would not be recalcuated until the order reached the payment state. On the delivery screen, the buyer may have seen one tax adjustment total, and on the payment screen another. This callback prevents this situation from occurring.</p>

<h3>In Practice: Updating adjustments</h3>

<p>When a line item&#39;s quantity changes, its related adjustments must also be recalculated. Take for example the shirt worth $50 with a 10% tax again. To calculate the correct price for a shirt, the calculation is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$50 + (10% of $50) = $55
</code></pre></div>
<p>When there are two shirts however, the calculation is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">($50 * 2) + (10% of ($50 * 2)) = $110
</code></pre></div>
<p>Previous versions of Spree recalculate all the adjustments on the order, whereas this latest work only calculates the adjustments for things that have changed.</p>

<h4>In the past</h4>

<p>In previous versions of Spree, the process of updating a line item triggers an excessive amount of events to take place. Whenever <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/12c749ed149210cbd89e8b257bb851b931cfa9c3/core/app/models/spree/line_item.rb#L93-L99">a line item is changed or destroyed, it calls <code>update_order</code></a> which recalculates that line item&#39;s tax charge and then calls the &quot;god method&quot;, <code>order.update!</code>. <code>order.update!</code> passes off to <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/12c749ed149210cbd89e8b257bb851b931cfa9c3/core/app/models/spree/order_updater.rb#L17-L43"><code>OrderUpdater#update</code></a> which does all of the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recalculates payment, item, adjustment and order totals</li>
<li>Updates order&#39;s payment state (but only if it&#39;s complete)</li>
<li>Updates each shipment on the order</li>
<li>Updates the shipment state for the order</li>
<li>Updates promotional adjustments</li>
<li>Updates shipping adjustments</li>
<li>Recalculates payment, item, adjustment and order totals again, as these may have changed due to adjustments changing.</li>
<li>Persists the totals to the database</li>
</ul>

<p>These actions take place for every single line item that has been changed or destroyed. Having the adjustments linked to the order -- rather than adjustments on a per-item basis -- is what probably lead to this complexity.</p>

<p>Similar to this is when a shipment is saved. The <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/12c749ed149210cbd89e8b257bb851b931cfa9c3/core/app/models/spree/shipment.rb#L273-L284"><code>ensure_correct_adjustment</code></a> method is called, which could potentially save and update an adjustment. If this happens, then the <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/12c749ed149210cbd89e8b257bb851b931cfa9c3/core/app/models/spree/adjustment.rb#L117-L119">adjustment itself calls <code>order.update!</code></a>, and for good measure the shipment has <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/12c749ed149210cbd89e8b257bb851b931cfa9c3/core/app/models/spree/shipment.rb#L286-L288">an additional callback to update the order too</a>.</p>

<h4>In the future</h4>

<p>In the new system, updating a line item <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/line_item.rb#L96-L104">will update only that item&#39;s adjustments</a>. The code that does this lives inside <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/item_adjustments.rb">the Spree::ItemAdjustments</a> class and is simple enough to understand easily.</p>

<p>Worth noting here is that the adjustment total and tax total are stored separately on the records being updated. This is so that a final price -- that is, the original price of the item plus any adjustments -- can be quickly calculated without doing extra database queries. Storing the tax amount separately allows us to easily show how much of that price is a tax adjustment, again without the extra database queries.</p>

<p>Updating adjustments themselves now no longer trigger the <code>OrderUpdater#update</code> event to take place. Instead, the amounts <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/adjustment.rb#L74-L82">are simply recalculated for the adjustment</a>, and no additional callbacks take place.</p>

<h2>Promotional adjustments within Spree</h2>

<p>On first thought, promotional adjustments are simpler than tax adjustments. This is simply not true, because both systems were conceived of by people. Whereas tax law dictates the correct place to add (or remove) a tax adjustment, promotional adjustment rules are dictated by people.</p>

<p>For example, a promotion that gives a buyer 10% off an order may only be valid
if their order is over $100 <em>and</em> the buyer has placed their order within a
certain timeframe <em>and</em> they&#39;re one of the first 100 people to do so. Or it
may only be valid if the buyer enters a specific coupon code, or visits a
specific page on the store. Applying this type of promotion is easy, as the
rules apply only to the order as a whole, rather than a line item for that
order.</p>

<p>More ridiculous rules are those that make the promotion adjustment eligible
only for some select line items within the cart; only shirts, for example. Any
code that attempts to apply these promotions needs to check each line item
within the order for its eligibility. If the rule qualifies the line item for
the promotional adjustment, then an adjustment should be applied. Similar
rules may exist for shipments.</p>

<p>In cases like these, promotional adjustments need to be applied on a per-line-
item basis, as opposed to one big adjustment on the entire order. Applying
them on a per-line-item basis also has the added benefit of easing a refund
process, just as mentioned previously with regards to tax adjustments. Where
possible, per-item adjustments should be applied from promotions, rather than
whole-order adjustments. This is due to the difficulty involved with potentially refunding a whole-order adjustment.</p>

<p>For cases where a rule applies to either a line item or a shipment, each line item and shipment must be checked against that particular rule. If the line item or shipment is found to be eligible for that rule, then the actions for that promotion should be taken <em>only</em> on those items. Items that are ineligible for the rule should be ignored.</p>

<h3>Eligible promotions</h3>

<p>To add some more complexity to the mix, some stores do not like it when two promotions are used at the same time. Let&#39;s say that the store has a promotion for 10% off all shirts this week, but they&#39;ve also given some of their customers a $10 off coupon.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s keep going with the $50 shirt example. If the user purchases the shirt during the 10% off promotion week <em>and</em> they use the $10 off coupon then two adjustments will be applied to the item. The first adjustment will be one of 10% of $50, which is $5. The second adjustment will be $10. These two adjustments combined, result in a $15 discount to a $50 item, rather than either $5 or $10.</p>

<p>To counteract this in Spree, we have a method called <code>choose_best_promotion_adjustment</code>. Once the adjustments to an item have been applied, the <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/item_adjustments.rb#L40-L49"><code>ItemAdjustments#choose_best_promotion_adjustment</code></a> method finds out which promotion is the best value for money, and marks all the <em>other</em> promotions as ineligible for that item. </p>

<p>This code means that in the case of our 10% and $10 off promotions, the $10
off promotion &quot;wins&quot; because it gives the best value for money. However, if
there are 3 shirts, each worth $50, on the same line item, the tables turn.</p>

<p>When the line item&#39;s quantity changes, it updates the total price of the line item to be $150. The <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/item_adjustments.rb#L19"><code>ItemAdjustments#update_adjustments</code></a> method updates each of the adjustments for that item. The adjustment for 10% off now subtracts $15 from the total, whereas the $10 adjustment still only subtracts $10. The 10% off adjustment now &quot;wins&quot; and is made eligible, and the previously eligible $10 adjustment is made ineligible.</p>

<h3>Promotions and Tax</h3>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting also that tax adjustments for an item are calculated based on the discounted price, rather than the full price. This is done for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>So that customers are not charged more tax than they should be.</li>
<li>To be compliant with the law.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Aside: This is clearly shown in <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/item_adjustments.rb#L19"><code>ItemAdjustments#update_adjustments</code></a>, where promotional adjustments are recalculated first, followed by tax adjustments.)</p>

<p>For point #1, take the example of the $50 shirt again. If this shirt has a $10 off discount applied to it, its purchase price will be $40. A tax rate of 10% means therefore that a tax amount of $4 would be applied to this item, rather than $5 if we assumed the base price, as we have done in the past.</p>

<p>The best place to see this happening is within the <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree/blob/28cd74adaa88232ceec269a33783f1a79cd470a2/core/app/models/spree/calculator/default_tax.rb#L29-L39"><code>DefaultTax</code> calculator</a>. The tax amounts for line items are calculated on the discounted amount -- the base amount minus any discounts -- rather than the base amount.</p>

<p>For point #2, there&#39;s two pages on the internet which show that this must be done. The first is <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/charging/discounts-etc.htm#1">HM Revenue &amp; Customs</a> which states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If any of your goods or services are discounted, you charge VAT on the discounted price rather than the full price.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second is <a href="http://www.boe.ca.gov/formspubs/pub113/">California State Board of Equalization</a>, which states under the header &quot;Nontaxable discounts and coupons&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A sale is made for $100 plus $8.25 sales tax. Upon prompt payment for the item the purchaser is allowed a discount of two percent of the sales price of $100. Since you are deducting the amount of the discount, $2, from taxable gross receipts, you are charging tax of $8.09 (8.25 percent of $98) to your customer.</p>

<p>When a discount of two percent is offered for prompt payment and an error is made and the discount of two percent is excluded from the computation, excess tax reimbursement of $0.16 will be collected from your customer ($8.25 - $8.09 = $0.16). The excess tax reimbursement should be returned to your customer or must be paid to the state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While these are only two examples in the greater scheme of things, we believe that these are most likely the type of tax situations which apply the world over.</p>

<p>By no longer collection this excess tax, the customer for a Spree store will now end up paying marginally less tax than they may have done in the past.</p>

<h2>Store credits</h2>

<p>The final area of adjustments to be discussed are store credits. These are typically manually applied to an order after the order has been completed by the buyer. The buyer may receive the store credit due to any number of reasons.</p>

<p>These credits are applied to the order as a whole and are the only time that a whole-order adjustment should be applied. In other situations, such as tax and promotional discounts, adjustments need to be potentially refunded along with the item.</p>

<p>Store credits, on the other hand, are manually applied adjustments. For an order with a store credit applied to it, care must be taken to ensure the correct refund is issued.</p>

<p>As an example, take the order that has been used as an example previously:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Line Item #1 (LI1): $50 shirt, $10 off. 10% tax.
Line Item #2 (LI2): $50 pants. 10% tax.
Shipment #1   (S1): Just the shirt. $5. 10% tax.
Shipment #2   (S2): Just the pants. $5. 10% tax.
</code></pre></div>
<p>The order&#39;s sub total is calculated like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">LI1        = ($50 - $10) + 10% of ($50 - 10) = $44
 +                                              +
LI2        = $50 + 10% of $50                = $55
                                                =
Subtotal   = $44 + 55                        = $99
                                                +
S1         = $5 + 10% of $5                  = $5
 +                                              +
S2         = $5 + 10% of $5                  = $5
                                                =
Total      = $99 + $10                       = $109
</code></pre></div>
<p>The order&#39;s total at this point is $109. Applying a store credit for $20 would cause the order&#39;s total to become $89. The line items&#39; and shipments&#39; amounts stay the same; it is only the order&#39;s total which has this modification applied. </p>

<p>If both items are returned to the store, the refund amount for each item will still be the original cost ($44 and $55 respectively). Care must be taken here to ensure that the buyer does not receive a greater refund than the amount that they paid. If both items were refunded to their full amount, they would receive a refund of $99, even though the order&#39;s total is $89 due to the store credit application. Spree does not protect against this, nor should it.</p>

   <title>Debugging Rails Controllers</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2013/09/debugging-rails-controllers"/>
   <updated>2013-09-05T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2013/09/debugging-rails-controllers</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&#39;s my flow for debugging a misbehaving controller. Imagine that there&#39;s a form at <code>app/views/messages/new.html.erb</code> that is posting to <code>MessagesController#create</code>. The parameters aren&#39;t being passed through from the form to the controller, and the model is raising a validation error saying that a field is blank -- even though it&#39;s <em>clearly</em> not.</p>

<h3>Step 0: Does restarting the server fix the problem?</h3>

<h3>Step 1: Check the form</h3>

<ul>
<li>Is the attribute defined in the correct place? </li>
<li>Is it using the form builder helper (i.e. <code>f.text_field</code>) or is it using <code>text_field_tag</code>? If it&#39;s supposed to be <code>params[:message][:body]</code> then it should be using the form builder. If not, then it should be using <code>text_field_tag</code> or similar.</li>
<li>Unlikely, but still possible: Is the field disabled before submission of the form? Disabled fields are not passed through as parameters.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Check the controller</h3>

<ul>
<li>Is the route to the controller defined correctly in <code>config/routes.rb</code>?</li>
<li>Is the controller set up to receive the right parameters?</li>
<li>Did I spell &#39;message&#39; with the correct number of &#39;s&#39;s within <code>params[:message]</code>?</li>
<li>Are the parameters from the form permitted using strong_parameters?</li>
<li>Are <em>all</em> the parameters from the form permitted?</li>
<li>Did I spell the parameters correctly? </li>
<li>What does the log output say for this controller? Does it contain the parameters I want with the values I want?</li>
<li>Can I place a <code>binding.pry</code> statement at the top of the action and print out <code>params</code> to see the correct parameters there too?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Check the model</h3>

<ul>
<li>If using <code>attr_accessible</code>, are the attribute marked as accessible?</li>
<li>Did I accidentally use <code>attr_accessor</code> when I meant to use <code>attr_accessible</code>?</li>
<li>Did I define a setter method for this attribute accidentally that doesn&#39;t actually set the attribute?</li>
<li>Is there a callback that unsets this parameter somehow?</li>
<li>If it&#39;s nested attributes that are being sent through, go check the nested model for the above.</li>
</ul>
