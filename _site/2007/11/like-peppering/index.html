        <p>So like all of like yesterday I was like doing work at like work and I was like working on like ticket printing and I like managed to like use like four like hundred tickets just to like get the positioning like right.</p>

<p>Now if I continued this blog post doing that it would get annoying, not only for me but for people who wasted their time reading all the &#8220;like&#8221;s.</p>

<p>The whole point of this blog post is to rant about how people, especially women (I&#8217;m not being sexist), pepper their sentences with the word &#8220;like&#8221; as a verbal filler, like the loud, fat woman on the train this afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey honey, would you like to do that thing we did last week?&#8221; (&#8220;legal&#8221; usage) &#8220;You know, like, what Scott and I did last week?&#8221; (&#8220;illegal&#8221; usage) &#8220;Yeah, like we went out on the town and like drunk lots and then we like went to a hotel and like stayed the night&#8221; (No she didn&#8217;t get a triple word score for this)</p>

<p>Then my personal favourite:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I&#8217;m saying?&#8221;</p>

<p>I twitched, or was it more like a spasm? Or maybe a mini-seizure, not sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah! <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;insert pig laughter here&gt; Like totally!&quot;</pre></p>

<p>Another twitch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then like we can like go to the like Casino and like gamble and like stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>This continued for the whole train journey.</p>

<p>Please, for the love of God. Do not pepper your sentences with &#8220;like&#8221;. It is a waste of breath, and a waste of time for whoever has to listen to your nonsense.</p>
