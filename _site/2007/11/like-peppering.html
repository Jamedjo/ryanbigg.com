        <p>So like all of like yesterday I was like doing work at like work and I was like working on like ticket printing and I like managed to like use like four like hundred tickets just to like get the positioning like right.</p>

<p>Now if I continued this blog post doing that it would get annoying, not only for me but for people who wasted their time reading all the &quot;like&quot;s.</p>

<p>The whole point of this blog post is to rant about how people, especially women (I&#39;m not being sexist), pepper their sentences with the word &quot;like&quot; as a verbal filler, like the loud, fat woman on the train this afternoon.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey honey, would you like to do that thing we did last week?&quot; (&quot;legal&quot; usage)
&quot;You know, like, what Scott and I did last week?&quot; (&quot;illegal&quot; usage)
&quot;Yeah, like we went out on the town and like drunk lots and then we like went to a hotel and like stayed the night&quot; (No she didn&#39;t get a triple word score for this)</p>

<p>Then my personal favourite:</p>

<p>&quot;You know what I&#39;m saying?&quot;</p>

<p>I twitched, or was it more like a spasm? Or maybe a mini-seizure, not sure.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah! <insert pig laughter here> Like totally!&quot;</p>

<p>Another twitch.</p>

<p>&quot;Then like we can like go to the like Casino and like gamble and like stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>This continued for the whole train journey.</p>

<p>Please, for the love of God. Do not pepper your sentences with &quot;like&quot;. It is a waste of breath, and a waste of time for whoever has to listen to your nonsense.</p>
