    <p>Tonight I was wondering what to have for dinner. I couldn&#8217;t decide if I should go out and get takeaway or go out and get some ingredients for food and cook it, so I made this:</p>

<p><span>code</span>options = <span>&#8220;Hungry Jacks&#8221;,&#8221;McDonalds&#8221;,&#8221;Subway&#8221;,&#8221;Cook it yourself, you lazy bogan!&#8221;,&#8221;Something from Fish &amp; Chip Shop&#8221;</span> puts options<span>rand(options.size)</span> <span>/code</span></p>
