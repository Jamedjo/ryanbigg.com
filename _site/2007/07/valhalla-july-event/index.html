<p>Was a very awesome night, and even though Paul, Thommo, Rick and Tom didn&#8217;t go, I sat with Devastator and had a good time.</p>

<p>I won the competition for Quake 3 Corkscrew and received the gift basket which contained:</p>

<p>2 cans of Fanta 3 cans of Coke 1 block of Kit-Kat Chocolate Overload Chocolate 1 230g packet of Smiths Thinly Cut Original Chips 1 Box of Arnott&#8217;s Savoury Shapes 1 Packet of Smarties 1 Block of Peppermint Aero 1 Bar of Chocolate Aero 1 Crunchie 1 Cherry Ripe 1 225g packet of Allens Frogs Alive (Red Frogs) 1 225g packet of Allens Party Mix</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been going to Valhalla for two years and I finally remember to bring my mousepad and win a competition. Coincidence? Probably.</p>

<p>Goodbye another weekend.</p>
