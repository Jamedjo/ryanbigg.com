        <p>Here&#8217;s the deal. I have a 50-year old uncle who:</p>

<ol>
<li>Eats my food.</li>

<li>Drinks my drink.</li>

<li>Cooks only for himself when needed.</li>

<li>Lays on the couch watching TV all the time.</li>

<li>Works very casually.</li>

<li>Pays not a cent towards bills, food or anything.</li>

<li>Smokes outside my window.</li>
</ol>

<p>He also plays the guitar.</p>

<p>I need to find him a new home. I will pay for all transport costs associated worldwide. Think I&#8217;m kidding? Try me. I just want him out of this house.</p>

<p>His name is Kym and he originally moved in here for &#8220;two days&#8221;. It&#8217;s been nearly three months. If you have a spare room and are willing to support him, then contact me at radar@frozenplague.net and I will arrange transport to your location for this leech.</p>
