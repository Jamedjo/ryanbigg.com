    <p><span>url=http://www.sealink.com.au</span>SeaLink<span>/url</span> recently launched their re-designed website, and today the boss came in and asked us to guess how many hits. Vish guessed correctly with 3000. This averages out to about 0.03 hits per second over the course of the day. I think I heard Adam say their server crashed too (due to a programming error, not an overload of visitors).</p>

<p><span>url=http://pulse.offbeat-zero.net</span>The Whatpulse Signature Images<span>/url</span> site on the other hand receives around 45000 hits per day, or 0.52 hits per second. The server has been stable for the whole time. This highlights what a wonderful server Adam is providing WSI with.</p>
