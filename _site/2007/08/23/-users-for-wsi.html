    <p>Sometime in the past week we reached 10,000 users with <span>url=http://pulse.offbeat-zero.net</span>WhatPulse Signature Images<span>/url</span>.</p>

<p>I kind of made a &#8220;promise&#8221; that I&#8217;d have a LAN party when this would happen and coincidentally there&#8217;s one this weekend called &#8220;Valhalla&#8221; which you may have heard of (I think I mentioned it once or twice). Free drinks on me.</p>

<p>P.S. <span>url=http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/</span>HAML rocks your world.<span>/url</span> Anyone who says otherwise is a liar and deserves to be exported to the Sun.</p>
