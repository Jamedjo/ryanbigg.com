        <small>28 Aug 2007</small><br>
        <p>Whilst this LAN was very close to the last one (almost exactly a month beforehand) attendance was good. Setup was done exceptionally quickly with, as Wookie stated &#8220;four times as many people as we needed&#8221;, and was finished at around 10:30. I arrived with <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/cameron.jpg</span>ShadowCamsy<span>/url</span> and <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/devastator-lanning.jpg</span>Devastator<span>/url</span>. I helped Moogie set up the <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/cool-poster.jpg</span>posters<span>/url</span> showing the details of the October 6th-7th LAN.</p>

<p>We let the lanners in a few (2) minutes early for a change and I played door bitch for about half an hour handing out the pink wriststraps before substituting my position with <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/the-aussie-bogan-sausages.jpg</span>TheAussieBogan<span>/url</span> who substituted his position with <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/commander-el.jpg</span>CommanderEl.<span>/url</span> Before I could settle down my friend Paul called and wanted me to give him his ticket so he could get in.</p>

<p><span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/wookie.jpg</span>Wookie<span>/url</span> was his usual &#8220;sunshine and lollipops&#8221; self, issuing orders (and lollipops, I&#8217;m serious), and threatening physical violence upon those who dared to cross him. Then his computer decided to <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/wookie-screen.jpg</span>screw itself over<span>/url</span> and eventually replaced the motherboard which was found to be faulty.</p>

<p><span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/sausages.jpg</span>Sausages<span>/url</span> were plentiful and free, with many lanners opting to have the non-charcoal sausages provided by TheAussieBogan and his minions. The St. Clair Recreation Centre&#8217;s canteen also provided toasted ham &amp; cheese sandwiches, which I suspect also contained epic win. Not bad for $2.50.</p>

<p><span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/red-bull-girls.jpg</span>The Redbull Girls<span>/url</span> also dropped in, doubling Valhalla&#8217;s girl population with their presence. They handed out free Red Bull to all lanners.</p>

<p>There were <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/prizes-1.jpg</span>many<span>/url</span>many<span>/url</span>prizes<span>/url</span>. <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/sub-1208.jpg</span>At 12:08pm, SuB-ZeRo (centre)<span>/url</span> was playing Tekken 5, <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/sub-2048.jpg</span>and at 8:48pm (posing like a retard, center)<span>/url</span>Sub was still playing the PS3. <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/sub-tekken-5.jpg</span>He won a Thermaltake Fan for the PS3 competition.<span>/url</span>Some noobs played Garry&#8217;s Mod, singleplayer.<span>/url</span>Kyorisu won a competition, I don&#8217;t know which one it was but he won something.<span>/url</span> Believe it or not, <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/mittens.jpg</span>Mittens<span>/url</span> and <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/unholee.jpg</span>Unholee<span>/url</span> both won at least one competition each. Also equally shocking was <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/seq-won-css-for-the-billionth-time-in-a-row.jpg</span>sequential gaming<span>/url</span> taking out the CS:S competition for the &#8220;18th time in a row&#8221;. The <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/sic-guys-won-ut2k4.jpg</span>Sharing is Caring team<span>/url</span> took out the UT2k4 competition.</p>

<p>I started playing QW:ET at 1pm and before I knew it people were asking me when I was going to get pizza, at 7:30. There needs to be a competition for this game once it comes out. Shame about the map repetitiveness. I went and got 25 pizzas for the lanners, during the course of which a girl at the pizza shop had a tantrum because she &#8220;couldn&#8217;t pre-sauce that many pizzas&#8221;. Arrived back with 25 pizzas which all disappeared pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Basketball was played on the bigger courts with a bunch of noobs (seems I didn&#8217;t get a picture!), taking that out and winning absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>I ran a Soldat competition in which a whole 9 people played in, and Mittens took it out with a 20-something point lead over Tetsu and Cyanara.</p>
