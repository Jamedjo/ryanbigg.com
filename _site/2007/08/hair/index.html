        <p>For this project at work we made a &#8220;pact&#8221; not to cut our hair or trim our beards until the project end, unknown at this point, assuming by the end of my contract (4th Dec, my birthday). So I thought. The other day the boss, Adam, walks in with a shorter haircut than the day previous. I make an objection and he says it was never part of &#8220;the rules&#8221; and everyone else agrees with him. So I decided I would get my hair cut.</p>

<p>The last time I had my hair cut was around the time Shrek 3 was just coming out (late May, I think). So it&#8217;s been a while. I let it get this far:</p>

<p>That&#8217;s probably the longest I&#8217;ve ever had it. I was starting to look like one of the Beatles. Tonight was &#8220;late-night shopping&#8221; so I got my hair cut down to: <span>img</span>http://www.frozenplague.net/images/other/hair-after.jpg<span>/img</span></p>

<p>That&#8217;s a weight off my shoulders.</p>
