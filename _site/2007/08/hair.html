        <small>23 Aug 2007</small><br>
        <p>For this project at work we made a &quot;pact&quot; not to cut our hair or trim our beards until the project end, unknown at this point, assuming by the end of my contract (4th Dec, my birthday). So I thought. The other day the boss, Adam, walks in with a shorter haircut than the day previous. I make an objection and he says it was never part of &quot;the rules&quot; and everyone else agrees with him. So I decided I would get my hair cut. </p>

<p>The last time I had my hair cut was around the time Shrek 3 was just coming out (late May, I think).  So it&#39;s been a while. I let it get this far:</p>

<p>That&#39;s probably the longest I&#39;ve ever had it. I was starting to look like one of the Beatles. Tonight was &quot;late-night shopping&quot; so I got my hair cut down to:

<p>That&#39;s a weight off my shoulders.</p>
