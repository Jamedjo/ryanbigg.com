        <small>11 Aug 2007</small><br>
        <p>On Saturday, 11th August yet another <span>url=&#8217;http://www.inlan.net.au&#8217;</span>InLAN<span>/url</span> event was held. At first I was reluctant to go, remembering last time that I went there was very little organisation in the event, and no competitions were run at all. I am happy to report that this time there was a much higher-level of organisation, and I can almost go as far as saying that is the best organisation I have seen. Competitions were run on time thanks to a well thought out timetable.</p>

<p>I left home at 8:30 (even though the event started at 10) because I had to collect drinks for myself and the two people I was bringing to the event, Nich (narthollis) and James (Devastator). Arriving at James&#8217; house and loading up the car I realised I had forgotten my monitor. We drove back to my house, arriving there at 9:45, collected my monitor and left. As an apology for making James and Nich late to InLAN, I shouted them McDonalds for lunch. $24.95, 9 hash browns, 2 Bacon &amp; Egg Muffins and 3 chocolate thickshakes later, we headed off to InLAN.</p>

<p>Arriving at the event we saw many people had already set up and some were still setting up, and there was a table near the door spare which Nich and I claimed. Setting up was easy as it&#8217;s just a routine I go through every event. Played a few games of Counter-Strike:Source GunGame and F.E.A.R. Combat with people from the event before the first competition began.</p>

<p>The first competition was Counter-Strike:Source GunGame. People had plenty of time to warmup in the practice server (thanks to Diesel for hosting it). The first gun in GunGame is the AWP, which is a powerful sniper rifle which kills in one shot. Thanks to the 5 seconds of freeze time, players were able to line up headshots on the opposing team and the millisecond the freeze time ended there was this tremendous boom of AWP firing. I managed to shoot someone, and therefore level up to the M249. Rushing to the other spawn point and killing whatever got in my way levelled me up to level 8. From there it was just rushing and killing whatever I could. A few other players reached the grenade level (23) before I did, and then I managed to catch up. Throwing a grenade into the T-Spawn resulted in someone dying. Little did I realise that my grenade had actually killed another player, and I was disappointed to hear someone was on the knife level. When I died I realised that player was me. Rushing the front lines again I ran up to someone and in one stab killed the player to take out the competition. For that I won a 320GB harddrive valued at $99.</p>

<p>At lunch time a sausage sizzle with copious amounts of sausages was provided. The lanners lined up in an as much of an orderly &#8220;line&#8221; as lanners do, and collected their free sausages. Also with the free sausages came free bread, free tomato sauce and free mustard. Compliments to the chefs. Dave, one of the admins of the event, had Gastro and left between the sausage sizzle and the second competition to rest at home. Even with one admin gone, the organisation was still at a high standard.</p>

<p>The second competition was an old-school Quake 1 1v1 Single-Elimination Deathmatch which was &#8220;won&#8221; (read: owned) by <span>url=img/valhalla/devastator.jpg</span>Devastator (file photo)<span>/url</span>. For his efforts he won a Logitech G5 Gaming Mouse.</p>

<p>The third competition was F.E.A.R. Combat, which there was a rather lengthy practice thanks to Night_Shade&#8217;s computer &#8220;not co-operating&#8221; and in which Devastator took a healthy lead of 80 something points. Night_Shade eventually joined the game, only to be plagued by more computer troubles. Devastator again took the lead and also took out this competition to win a Sennheiser PC130 headset which he promptly gave away to a random at the LAN FOR FREE. Second prize (1GB Flash Disk) was awarded to Spike after a second round, and I claimed third prize (two chocolate bars).</p>

<p>The final competition was TrackMania: Nations which was won by Insane Gazebo who managed to somehow go around the course in just under a minute. Second prize went to Devastator and third went to a random.</p>

<p>Throughout the day coffee runs were performed and for dinner the traditional pizza was devoured. Entry to the event was only $20 and that included pizza.</p>
