        <p>There&#8217;s this lady who works in the accounts department at SeaLink and they call her Rocky. She got that nickname for apparently coming into work with a broken neck. On Sunday night her mum suddenly passed away and she took the week off work to grieve. The funeral is today.</p>

<p>And then <span>url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,22448973-2682,00.html</span>this happened last night<span>/url</span>. Rocky&#8217;s son was killed in a car rollover last night when he was only 17. I can&#8217;t imagine her emotional state right now, after losing her mother so quickly and then her son.</p>
