    <p>I was talking to <span>url=/images/other/tom.jpg</span>Tom (file photo)<span>/url</span> tonight and the conversation went a bit like this:</p>

<p>quote=&#8221;Conversation&#8221;M) Radar: I AM GOD. (9:15:36 PM) Tom: no no your not (9:15:44 PM) Radar: I like to think I am. (9:16:04 PM) Radar: Regardless of whether SHE likes it or not. (9:16:18 PM) Radar: I figure, if Satan is the &#8220;Prince of Darkness&#8221; and supposed to be opposite to God, then god must be the &#8220;Princess&#8221; (9:16:19 PM) Tom: whos she? (9:16:30 PM) Tom: lol i see (9:16:37 PM) Radar: You&#8217;ve been insulting her. (9:16:39 PM) Radar: She&#8217;ll be pissed. (9:16:42 PM) Tom: lol (9:16:48 PM) Radar: No wonder why she&#8217;s smote so many humans. (9:16:52 PM) Tom: now that&#8217;s a different way of looking at it <span>/quote</span></p>

<p>Also, you may have seen something about RESTful routes. That&#8217;s coming later. Also Rails Generators will rock your world. Two blogs coming up in the next week.</p>
