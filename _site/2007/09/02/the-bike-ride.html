    <p>Today for Father&#8217;s Day my dad and I rode <span>url=http://frozenplague.net/images/other/ride-2092007.jpg</span>this distance<span>/url</span> where 1cm is 500m.</p>

<p>In the future I hope to do a bike ride that my friend Ray and I did, which was down the River Torrens Pathway to the mouth, across to West Lakes and back up to Adelaide using Port Road (which just so happens to have the slightest incline and really kills you). The ride is about 30 kilometres long and <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/other/proposed-ride.jpg</span>goes something like this.<span>/url</span> On the lower right of the image where all the black lines converge is the train station.</p>

<p>Consider this an open invite. If you&#8217;re fit and willing to come, meet at the train station in town at midday (12pm, for the slow among you) in three weeks and bring your bike.</p>
