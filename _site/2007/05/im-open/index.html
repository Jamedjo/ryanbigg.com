        <p>A lady approached my checkout today with a large trolley with green bags hung over one of the loops on the baby seat.
&quot;Are you open?&quot; she asked, innocently.
&quot;Well, that depends.&quot;
&quot;What on?&quot;
&quot;Well, if today is Monday and the time is between 7am and 11am, during which time I am required by penalty of death or loss of my dearly-beloved job to work, then the answer is yes. Also if the little red sign, similar to one of these,&quot; I say, grabbing the close sign from under my register and holding it up, &quot;is <em>not</em> placed at the end of my register then yes, I am open. Also, if I have a look on my face that closely resembles boredom the answer is still most probably yes.&quot;
&quot;So are you open?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to soar like an eagle when you&#39;re surrounded by turkeys.</p>

<hr>

<p>Today was one of the very, very few days of the year that I actually get mail. It was a small package with a slight bulge in it, and I assumed either it was a nice lump of cash or something from my future employer.</p>

<p>I opened it and read the first page:</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Ryan,
This letter is to confirm our verbal offer of employment and acceptance to the position of Web Developer - for a six month contract.&quot;</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>
