        <p>A lady approached my checkout today with a large trolley with green bags hung over one of the loops on the baby seat. &#8220;Are you open?&#8221; she asked, innocently. &#8220;Well, that depends.&#8221; &#8220;What on?&#8221; &#8220;Well, if today is Monday and the time is between 7am and 11am, during which time I am required by penalty of death or loss of my dearly-beloved job to work, then the answer is yes. Also if the little red sign, similar to one of these,&#8221; I say, grabbing the close sign from under my register and holding it up, &#8220;is <em>not</em> placed at the end of my register then yes, I am open. Also, if I have a look on my face that closely resembles boredom the answer is still most probably yes.&#8221; &#8220;So are you open?&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to soar like an eagle when you&#8217;re surrounded by turkeys.</p>

<p>Today was one of the very, very few days of the year that I actually get mail. It was a small package with a slight bulge in it, and I assumed either it was a nice lump of cash or something from my future employer.</p>

<p>I opened it and read the first page:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Ryan, This letter is to confirm our verbal offer of employment and acceptance to the position of Web Developer - for a six month contract.&#8221;</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>
