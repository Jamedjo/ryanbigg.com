        <p>The Friday just gone (well, 4 days ago), was my last day working at Coles. A customer with her kid came through my register, and the kid was coughing up BOTH lungs and sounding not all that good about it.</p>

<p>I joked about it, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be funny if I got sick on my last day?&quot;</p>

<p>It happened. I now have a cold which I think I&#39;m smack-bang in the middle of. It&#39;s wrapped itself around my vocal chords and my voice cracks whenever I try to speak, even saying something simple like &quot;Bye&quot; comes out all distorted.</p>

<p>I hope that this thing goes away before Monday. Wouldn&#39;t that be horrible? Turning up to a new job and being sick on the first day.</p>

<p>My energy&#39;s completely shot by about 6&#39;oclock every night and I haven&#39;t been able to have a good sleep-in because my throat&#39;s been feeling like crap.</p>

<p>If anyone wants my cold, they may take it, $4.95 + Postage &amp; Handling.</p>
