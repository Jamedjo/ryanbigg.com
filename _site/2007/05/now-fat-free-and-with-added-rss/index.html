        <p>Today, on the suggestion of <span>url=http://www.intrevio.com</span>Seth Lopez<span>/url</span>, I implemented RSS into this site.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using Firefox you should see a little orange feed symbol in your address bar which looks like: <span>img</span>img/other/rss/url.jpg<span>/img</span></p>

<p>When you click it it takes you to another page which will allow you to subscribe to my site&#8217;s feed.</p>

<p>Further yet, if you want to get updates through Thunderbird that&#8217;s also possible.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Thunderbird.</li>

<li>Go to Tools -&gt; Account Settings.</li>

<li>Click Add Account.</li>

<li>Click the &#8220;RSS News &amp; Blogs&#8221; radio button, then click Next.</li>

<li>Type whatever name you want for your feeds. Click next and then finish.</li>

<li>Now in the left window of the &#8220;Account Settings&#8221; screen you will see an option with the name you specified in #5. Click that.</li>

<li>Click the &#8220;Manage Subscriptions&#8230;&#8221; button on the right side of that window.</li>

<li>A new window should pop-up. Click the Add button.</li>

<li>Type in &#8220;http://www.frozenplague.net/rss&#8221; into the Feed URL box.</li>

<li>You should now see a folder icon with the title &#8220;The Life of a Radar&#8221;. Opening up this folder presents you with a satellite dish with the title &#8220;The Life of a Radar&#8221; again. Close that window.</li>

<li>Above your regular email you should now see your RSS News &amp; Blogs account, with the name you wrote in #5.</li>

<li>In that folder will be &#8220;The Life of a Radar&#8221;, in bold and with a number in brackets.</li>

<li>Clicking it will bring up a list, similar looking to the email list you&#8217;re familiar with, of blog posts on this site.</li>

<li>Clicking a blog post will bring it up.</li>
</ol>

<p>Welcome to RSS.</p>

<p>P.S. My cold has ran away, if you find it, please DO NOT RETURN IT TO ME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. Keep it as a reward.</p>
