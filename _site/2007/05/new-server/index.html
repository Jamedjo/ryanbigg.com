        <p>Sometimes I don&#39;t know why I do it. I turn on my computer before going off to do other things. Then when I inevitably return, there&#39;s a few messages of people screaming bloody murder because my site has an error, or they want to look at a piece of code. The last thing I want to do when I get home is to &quot;help&quot; people. That&#39;s what I do all day at work. Give me time to sit down, eat dinner, get out of my work clothes, read a comic or three and then I&#39;ll jump straight back into working on fixing whatever bugs you may find. I&#39;ll even be nice.</p>

<p>You may realise by now that there isn&#39;t a blog post before this one. This is because some idiot (me) forgot to backup his MySQL database, I had everything else backed up except that. It only had one blog post in it anyway, and I wish to re-write it. The blog post was titled &quot;Goodbye, Good Luck and Get Out of my Store&quot; and here&#39;s how I want to write it today:</p>

<p>Dear Customers,
I have been working at Coles for 2 years, 2 months and 6 days now. It&#39;s time for me to leave, I have found another job somewhere else, that pays more and has better working conditions (including chairs). You may know me as the &quot;spiky-haired guy&quot; or the &quot;one-with-the-grumpy-face&quot;, but that&#39;s only some of the time. I can be nice, but sometimes it takes a little incentive. That&#39;s just how I am. I would like to address you in groups.</p>

<p>[b]The Elderly[/b]
I don&#39;t know how you do it, but every day you manage to bring in those green bags of yours. Equally repetitive is your famous catch-cry of &quot;Hold on, Dear! I have green bags.&quot; as I start scanning them items you put up before your green bags. </p>

<p>Yes, you can be slow, and lets face it, I&#39;m an impatient bastard, but you do eventually give me a friendly smile and say goodbye. This makes you unique, in a special way. You can give me the correct change most of the time also, which is sometimes a good thing.</p>

<p>[b]The Asians[/b]
If it wasn&#39;t for your consistent buying of discounted items our bins would be over-flowing with out of date stock. You are reliable, efficient and smart. You stare at the monitor looking for mistakes, and if there&#39;s one you kindly remind me. Sometimes I&#39;ll miss one, but you can just go up to the Service Desk and get your 18c refund.</p>

<p>[b]The People Who Talk On Mobile Phones Whilst Being Served[/b]
I find you funny, most of the time. Other times you&#39;re tolerable, but I would prefer it if you put your mother on hold for the &lt; 2 minutes it takes me to serve you. You don&#39;t need to shout &quot;HELLO?!&quot; down the phone. We don&#39;t get signal in the building. Don&#39;t ignore me when I tell you that we don&#39;t, believe me, I&#39;ve tried.</p>

<p>In short: Hang up, at least say &quot;hello&quot; to me, get served, get out, and then call them back when you&#39;re not inside.</p>

<p>[b]The Parents With Screaming Kids[/b]
This is Coles. Last I know, Coles is not a kindergarten, crech√©, or any other child-care facility. I respect the fact that you don&#39;t want to leave your kids home alone, or in the car, but please, keep them under control when you&#39;re in the store. Occasionally I&#39;m tempted to call security because your children are being absolute ferals. Control your kids.</p>

<p>Aside: Apparently I used to be one of those kids too. Thankfully, they grow up.</p>

<p>[b]FlyBuys users[/b]
Lets point out a few points that you should know during the transactional process:
1. Before handing me the cash, it is wise to hand me the flybuys card. You may also do this during the process, but not after. I have very quick fingers that like to hit the Cash -&gt; Enter button. My job is to scan your items and get you out of the store.
2. You can not use your FlyBuys on the $1.00 bread you bought. It only works for amounts of $5 and over.
3. You get 2 points / $5. Get a life, seriously.
4. If I &quot;forget&quot; to ask you, it&#39;s not my fault. Would you be sick of asking for FlyBuys for every customer?</p>

<p>For this point let&#39;s elaborate some. Say, on average, it takes me 1 minute to serve customers (on express). Over a 9 hour day I take 1 1/2 hours for lunch &amp; tea breaks. So that&#39;s 7.5 hours, or 450 minutes. So that&#39;s 450 times I have to ask for FlyBuys. Not going to happen.</p>

<p>That is, unless someone can provide me with a YakBak. Those things were cool back in the day.</p>
