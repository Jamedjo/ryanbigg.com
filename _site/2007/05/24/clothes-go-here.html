<p>My brother seems to not know where they go, so I made that little sign so that he knows.</p>

<p>In other news, tomorrow is my last day at <span>s</span>Hell<span>/s</span> Coles, and it&#8217;s casual day! I hope everything goes smoothly and I&#8217;ll see you on the other side.</p>

<p>Oh, and about Monday Night, it starts at 6:30, at my house. If you don&#8217;t know where that is you know how to contact me. Bring $5 for pizza.</p>
