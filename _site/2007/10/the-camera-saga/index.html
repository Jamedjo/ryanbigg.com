        <p>I was talking with my brother about him wanting to buy a new camera about a month or two ago but him not having the money. I looked at the Fuji Finepix 9100 which is just a slight upgrade from my Fuji Finepix 5600 and I loved it. I looked on eBay only to find that one was listed too expensive for my tastes.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, I <span>url=http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;rd=1&amp;item=220137983380&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT&amp;ih=012</span>found this one.<span>/url</span> Little did I know of the hell I had to go through to get it. $80 postage was OK I thought, as long as it arrived within the stated 1-3 days. First of all, contacting the buyer to get the account details. This was a rally of about 6 emails to get all the information needed to transfer to his bank account. This is because I could not transfer money to a Hong Kong bank account using my internet banking provided by CommunityCPS. So, I got all the information and eventually was slugged with a $55 telegraphic transfer fee by my bank. So now it&#8217;s cost me $630 for this camera, and it still has to arrive.</p>

<p>I respect the fact there was a weekend between the 27th (when the seller notified me the item was sent off) and today, but the item listing CLEARLY states 1-3 days shipping $80, thus I expect it to be here within 1-3 days (yeah, I&#8217;m ignoring the fine print. This is not a peak season like Christmas). It&#8217;s now been 5 business days (including the Labor day public holiday) and I really want that camera for Valhalla.</p>

<p><em>sigh</em> Next time I&#8217;m just going to fork out the money and buy it from a retailer so I have it immediately in hand. This experience has turned me off eBay.</p>
