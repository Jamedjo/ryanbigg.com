    <p>I unfortunately missed the &#8220;debate&#8221; between the Horrible John Howard and Kevin &#8220;K. Rudd&#8221; Rudd, and then today this came up in IRC: <p class='quote'>
&lt;LegionX&gt; lol..... how sad... a torrent of yesterdays debate... ;-P
&lt;Radar&gt; haha :)
&lt;Radar&gt; I doubt if you could call it a "debate"
&lt;Radar&gt; needed more fight.
&lt;stefan&gt; and less about the worm already
&lt;LegionX&gt; they need an open debate.. with all candidates.... so all the loony parties can speak ;-)
&lt;Radar&gt; Then would it be called a "mass debate"?

<p>Think about it. It&#8217;ll come to you eventually.</p>
