            <small>21 Oct 2007</small><br>
            <p>I blogged a month or two ago, a fictional story based on this short teenaged italian kid who gets on the train every now and then. Usually he board the train with his friends and talks himself up, bragging about who he beat up this week. This week he boarded the train at Mawson Lakes, and punched the door. He was shouting obscenities at someone. I was on my laptop, so I didn&#39;t pay much attention to him.</p>

<p>He usually gets off at Ovingham, and this time he did also. This is the same stop the fat lady on the wheelchair waits for the train driver to get out of the cabin and put down the planks so she can wheel all 150kg of her fat ass out the door. So the train was stopped.</p>

<p>All of a sudden there&#39;s a noise outside of the train doors and all the passengers are looking outside at something. I was sitting with my back to the door so I didn&#39;t catch the start of it. What I&#39;m assuming is that this angsty Italian kid picked a fight with someone he shouldn&#39;t have as he got off the train. Still assuming, the hero of this story got off the train with the kid and they proceeded to fight. Let me pause there.</p>

<p>The hero is a 30, possibly 40 something white male dressed in business attire, black pants, light-pink shirt and tie. The kid is dressed in typical teenager clothes.</p>

<p>And now let&#39;s resume the story. By everyone else looking at what was going on outside it grabbed my attention also. So I turned to see what was happening and I see this kid try to punch this guy. He missed. The hero then rises one leg, pulls it back to his body and then kicks out all in one swift motion as the kid comes at him again. The kick plants itself directly into the kid&#39;s stomach. This made many people laugh and cringe. The fight continues, going down the outside of the train and out of my view.</p>

<p>The kid deserved it. He&#39;s rude, he boards without a ticket, and he&#39;s obnoxious. I just hope the next time he starts a fight with someone the train&#39;s still moving when they open the doors and he&#39;s the first one out.</p>
