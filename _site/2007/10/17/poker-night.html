    <p>When I was attending TAFE me and my friends used to play cards. I haven&#8217;t played cards in ages, and I&#8217;m kind of missing that fact.</p>

<p>So I thought I would host a Poker night for the 27th October. Open invitation. It will no longer be held at my Dad&#8217;s house. It will be held at a friend&#8217;s house who has kindly volunteered his shed for it. You know how to contact me.</p>

<p>EDIT: Yes I did have the third of November listed here as the date, but I had told people that it would be &#8220;not this saturday but the one after&#8221;, so just to make it clear it&#8217;s the 27th of October.</p>
