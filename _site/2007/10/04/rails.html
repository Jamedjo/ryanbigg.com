    <p>Rails 2.0 Preview Release 1 was released a couple of days ago. The original idea was of this post to go through all the changelogs and find out all the stuff I thought was cool and list it here. The problem is that there&#8217;s too much cool stuff. <span>url=http://blog.rubyonrails.org/2007/9/30/rails-2-0-0-preview-release</span>DHH summed it up quite nicely.<span>/url</span></p>

<p>My favourites are:</p>

<ol>
<li>has_one and has_many for restful routes. For example, <span>term</span>map.resources :forums, :has_many =&gt; :topics<span>/term</span>.</li>

<li>Sexy migrations.</li>

<li>The way it loads faster, mashing all the javascript/css into one file so it only gets two files (one for js, one for css) instead of 6 or 7.</li>

<li>Instead of specifying <span>term</span>topic_path(@topic)<span>/term</span> for a topics path, now you can do <span>term</span>topic_path<span>/term</span> and Rails will know what you&#8217;re talking about.</li>
</ol>

<p>One thing I&#8217;m annoyed at is that routes like <span>term</span>forum_edit_topic_path(forum,topic) <span>/term</span> to edit a topic now become: <span>term</span>edit_forum_topic_path(forum,topic)<span>/term</span> Going through each page and finding all the routes that use this will be a pain, and I&#8217;m considering making a small ruby script to do it for me.</p>

<p>TOMORROW, I hope to get the LPC report up!</p>
