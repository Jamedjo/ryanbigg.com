<p>I was interviewed this morning by Hannah Silverman from the Advertiser in regards to the photo (right) that I sent to them. She asked me a lot of questions like: <ul>
	<li>When did it happen? (7:51AM train from Elizabeth)</li>
	<li>What line did it happen on? (Gawler)</li>
	<li>What was your reaction? ("I've gotta get a photo of that.")</li>
	<li>Was there anybody near the doors? (No)</li>
	<li>What did you think was the problem with the doors being open? (If there was a small child they would've gone to look out of the doors and might've fallen out)</li>
	<li> What was everyone else's reaction? (Nonchalant, treating it like it was a regular occurance now)</li>
	<li>What do you think of the train system? ("I think it's a heap of crap.")</li>
	<li>What's wrong with the train system? (Ticket prices increasing, service degrading)</li>
	<li>Contact Details? (You, as in the reader of this blog, are not getting them)</li>
</ul> I hope after all the questions that an article gets published somewhere about this. It would be awesome.</p>

<p>UPDATE #1: Hannah called just before lunch asking me to confirm that it was yesterday. After I got back from lunch, she called again and asked me to pose for a photograph at the Adelaide Train Station. Honestly, I never expected it to get this far. I thought &#8220;hey, they&#8217;ve been hammering this for a while&#8221; so I sent it to them.</p>

<p>UPDATE #2: So I&#8217;ve just gotten back from getting my photo taken at least 50 times in random positions, walking onto the train, leaning against the train, leaning against the barrier. The photographer said it &#8220;might be on the front page&#8221;. If they&#8217;ve taken a photo of me and it&#8217;s in the paper, everyone gets free papers.</p>

<p>UPDATE #3: The photo I took on Wednesday was on the front page. I read the paper cover-to-cover and my photo&#8217;s not in there. It might be in Saturday&#8217;s paper, giving me a weekend to buy a disguise to deceive the AdelaideMetro thugs. <a href='http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,22921394-5006301,00.html' title='The Story'>The story was also on the AdelaideNow site</a>!</p>

<p>UPDATE #4: &#8220;Uncle Fester&#8221; from Port Adelaide posted this comment on the AdelaideNow site, which gave me a chuckle: <p align='center'>"That looks like the DSTO in the background of the photo. Does Ryan Bigg realise he has committed a federal offense by photographing a secure Commonwealth site?"</p> Another commenter, David of Oaklands Park, posted this: <p align='center'>"Would have thought that the fires on Kangaroo Island justify a front page more than a Mr Bigg!!"</p> Thanks David! The fires have been burning for 8 days. The train doors have been malfunctioning longer. Fire can be put out, and all of the time eventually it does happen! The train doors unfortunately will not fix themselves and it&#8217;s up to AdelaideMetro and &#8220;The Government&#8221; to do something about it.</p>

<p>Another one of my gripes is there is not a single window on any carriage I have traveled on this week that some delinquent has not scratched his tag into. I believe this prompts the &#8220;other delinquents&#8221; to do the same after seeing that other people can get away with it. Replace the windows with something that can&#8217;t be scratched, or replace them more often to deter these bastards from blocking my view with their scrawl.</p>

<p>UPDATE #Infinity - Infinity + 5: Googling for my name (Ryan Bigg) returns the article as the second result in &#8220;the web&#8221; and first for &#8220;pages from Australia&#8221;.</p>

<p>UPDATE #6: <a href='http://frozenplague.net/images/IMG_0004.jpg'>Freakin' Huge (tm) front page scan is here </a></p>
