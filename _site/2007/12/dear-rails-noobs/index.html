        <font size='7'>SCAFFOLD HAS BEEN DEPRECATED AS OF RAILS 2.0.</font>
<p>There has seemingly been an infinite number of posts to the ruby on rails talk mailing list going &#8220;OMG SCAFFOLD IS NOT WORKING!!11!11PLZHALPNOW!1&#8221;. I want all the newbies out there to understand that the <strong>Agile Web Development</strong> book is useless! (well, that part). STOP POSTING THAT SCAFFOLDING IS NOT WORKING. It is very irritating.</p>

<p>If you took the time out of your obviously extremely busy schedules and <a href='http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=rails+2.0+scaffold&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta='>actually googled "Rails 2.0 scaffold"</a> you will see that the wonderful Google hamsters have scoured the internet and found people with such hastiness as yourselves! GOOGLE BEFORE ASKING. It saves a crap load of effort on both sides and stops me writing nasty posts like this.</p>

<p>Maybe your New Year&#8217;s Resolution can be to <a href='http://justfuckinggoogleit.com/'>"Just Fucking Google It".</a></p>
