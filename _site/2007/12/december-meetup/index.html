        <p>There was an Adelaide Ruby Users Group meeting held last night at the usual location, the Brecnock Hotel on King William Street. This was the first meeting my friend, Tom, had decided to come to and he caught the train into town from Gawler. He eventually arrived at the other end of town at around 5:30 and phoned me up asking where I was. His voice seemed to echo too much, and the stairway in our building doesn&#8217;t echo like it did. I eventually figured out that he was in the TSR building and managed to get up to Level 2 unhindered. Great security the TSR guys have.</p>

<p>I finished up at work and then Anuj, Vishal, The Other Mongrel and I headed over to the Brecnock. Adam and Ali had other things to do and Michael still had his time off from work due to an operation he had.</p>

<p>We ordered our food at about quarter-past 6. It arrived at around 7ish in typical Brecnock style.</p>

<p>The meeting begun at 6:30 and begun with Luke talking about merb and Datamapper. Whilst very interestin, the talk was very long (at least an hour). I will try to grab a video of his talk once it&#8217;s up on the internet.</p>

<p>Afterwards I did a talk on Railscamp with 20 photos that I or other people (Lachie, Tim Lucas, Ryan Allen and Ross Hill) took at Railscamp. I rattled off a list of what presentations there were at Railscamp and this started a talk on Git. The Git talk went on for a while, and it was already 9:00 by this time so Tom and I decided to leave. Apparently the other guys only continued until about 9:15, and the talk turned to usability.</p>

<p>Tom thought it was really good and he said he&#8217;d definitely be going to the next one.</p>

<p>So why don&#8217;t you come as well?</p>
