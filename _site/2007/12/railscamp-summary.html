        <small>07 Dec 2007</small><br>
        <p>I promised you guys a summary of Railscamp. Unfortunately I managed to lock myself out of sudo on my laptop AND hastily reinstall ubuntu. I could&#39;ve sworn I had a backup on here somewhere.</p>

<p>Fortunately I&#39;m supposed to be doing a very short presentation about what went on at Railscamp so I should have at least SOMETHING by next weekend!</p>

<p>Been very busy as of late. The blog went down and I&#39;ve been playing around with WordPress as a replacement instead of re-inventing the wheel yet again. I simply do not have the time or energy to do something that massive again. WordPress does everything I want it to.</p>

<p>On last weekend&#39;s Saturday I shaved off the beard and it was itchy. I don&#39;t recommend it for anybody to grow a beard for 6 months and shave it all off in one go. It&#39;s like that feeling when you get your hair cut and it goes down the back of your shirt. Now imagine that on your face 10 fold.</p>

<p>Also on the Tuesday  (the 4th) just gone, I turned 20. Went out for dinner the Sunday before with my dad, Monday night had dinner at Mum&#39;s, Tuesday night was poker, Wednesday night was Cafe Primo, Thursday night was play-around-with-blog night and tonight was get-everything-imported-into-wordpress night.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night I&#39;m off to InLAN with Narthollis, Devastator and Freddy. This InLAN is free and doesn&#39;t have prizes, but we&#39;ll still own all the noobs.</p>
