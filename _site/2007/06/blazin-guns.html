            <p>Today I went shooting at the Marksman Security Training &amp; Indoor Range on Franklin Street in the city with Tom, his dad, his uncle and his dad&#39;s friend.</p>

<p>It was $60 each for the five of us and we got to fire:</p>

<p>30x 9mm Glock semi-auto
10x 45ACP Glock semi-auto
12x .357 Magnum revolver
6x .44 Magnum revolver</p>

<p>Firstly we watched a training video on how to use the guns and what safety precautions to follow, stuff like don&#39;t point the gun at other people, always aim it down range and how to reload it.</p>

<p>Then we went into the &quot;Range A&quot; area, where we went through again the precautions and how to load and fire the two Glocks. I was much more accurate with the 9mm Glock due to the lower recoil on it, the 45ACP was a larger gun with more of a recoil, and it shot more to the left of where I thought I was aiming it.</p>

<p>After Range A, we moved into Range B where we fired the Magnums. We were pre-warned that we may experience &quot;a slightly more powerful recoil&quot; and I was surprised at exactly how much recoil these things had. The .357 wasn&#39;t too bad, but the reload time wasn&#39;t ideal, I guess someone who uses this gun in a real life situation would be more proficient at reloading than what I was. The .44 was nuts! You load up this massive revolver with 6 shots and you expect a similar recoil to the .357 but it&#39;s nearly twice as much, it jars the whole arm, then you have another 5 shots to go. </p>

<p>And I collected two shells from the magnums</p>

<p>Was a wonderful time and I would suggest it to anyone who wants a way to rid themselves very quickly of $60.</p>
