    <p>I tried to write a blog, it didn&#8217;t have the same feel as my old ones. So I scrapped it.</p>

<p>Then I tried to write another one, scrapped it too.</p>

<p>Then I wrote this one.</p>

<p>Now I need sleep.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have something more substantial up on the weekend, probably.</p>
