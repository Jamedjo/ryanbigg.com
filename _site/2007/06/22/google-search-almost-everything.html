    <p>Today I was looking for the correct syntax of &#8220;&lt;=&gt;&#8221;, I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was &lt;=&gt; or &lt;==&gt;, so I typed both of them into Google and got back a blank result, not even a &#8220;Your search - &lt;=&gt; - did not match any documents.&#8221; message. I felt unloved!</p>

<p>So my question to Google is: &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you returning results for this string?&#8221;</p>

<p>If anyone is knowledgeable in this subject, please fill me in. I had the idea that I could enter anything into Google and get back unimpeded results, but this does not appear to be the case.</p>
