        <small>15 Jun 2007</small><br>
        <p>For those of you that don&#39;t know, there&#39;s a show out called &quot;Pimp My Ride!&quot;. On the show, people give their cars to a group of pros (Xzibit and his crew) and they pimp out the ride, adding overkill entertainment systems and generally making the rides look sweet.</p>

<p>My mum&#39;s friend Charmaine was having computer troubles a while back, I thought I would be nice and go over there and check it out and, hopefully, fix the issue. The Computer, and I use that term very loosely, was running Windows 98. 98 was released in, you guessed it, 1998, making it nine years old. </p>

<p>That&#39;s about 90 years in real life. It&#39;s old. It&#39;s fragile. It whines at everything. It&#39;s ugly.</p>

<p>To top it off, the computer is running on 200mhz with 32mb of RAM. It has a freakin&#39; turbo button for God&#39;s sake! I suppose I should mention now that she&#39;s on dial-up too.</p>

<p>Now if you look at [url=/img/pimpmycase/old-case-back.jpg]the back of the case[/url] you will notice many things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The case is U shaped, meaning the top and both sides come off in one piece.</li>
<li>It&#39;s old and dusty.</li>
<li>There&#39;s no PS/2 ports.</li>
<li>There&#39;s no USB ports.</li>
<li>It has an RS232 port.</li>
<li>It has a parallel port.</li>
<li>It has a serial port.</li>
<li>It makes your eyes water.</li>
</ol>

<p>Originally I brought around my m-robe, thinking I&#39;ll be able to put some programs on the computer and fix her problems, but without a USB port there was no chance of that happening.</p>

<p>During the first time I was there Charmaine talked about eventually upgrading the computer. She mentioned that she might consider it more after she returned from her trip to Canada. </p>

<p>She returned a few weekends ago and her husband gave me some cash for a new everything. Here&#39;s what I got her:
Motherboard: Asus AM2-940 M2N8-VMX $65
RAM: 1GB DDR2 667 5300 $45
Monitor: Viewsonic 17&quot; VA703B 8ms $215
Power Supply: 550 Max. SHAW PSU $25
Case: CM Ammo RC-533 $89
Keyboard: Multimedia Slim Keyboard $7
Mouse: Generic Optical Mouse $7
DVD Drive: Samsung 18x Black DVD-RW $38
CPU: AM2-940 x2 Dual Core 3600+ $88
Harddrive: 80GB Maxtor $50</p>

<p>Total: $629.00
Budget: $650.00</p>

<p>I only got the CPU because they were out of the 3200s and I didn&#39;t want to wait another week for them to order in the parts and go to the trouble of having to go down there again.</p>

<p>This is a whole system and that&#39;s an awesome price. Now for a very-near bleeding edge kit you&#39;d pay something like $2.5k.</p>

<p>Anyway, there&#39;s some pics of the new case and associated other things at [url=/img/pimpmycase]Pimp My Case[/url]. Enjoy.</p>
