        <p>Another work of fiction based on my obsessive need to tell people not to press the damn button over and over again! I suppress it usually.</p>

<p>One day on the way to work I was walking my usual route through town. I walked up to a set of traffic lights and found one of my friends pushing the button over and over again. I walked closer and said, &#8220;You know it doesn&#8217;t matter how many times you push that button, it isn&#8217;t going to change any faster. &#8220;Hi Ryan.&#8221; He replied. &#8220;Did you know the energy you put into pushing that button could be better spent increasing your cranial capacity?&#8221; &#8220;I do now&#8221;, he said, still pushing the button. &#8220;The first time someone pushes the button it inserts a single function into the cycle of the lights, basically telling the &#8220;don&#8217;t walk&#8221; sign at the other end to change to a &#8220;walk&#8221; sign if the button is pressed. You could press it a billion times, although I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d have enough time between light changes.&#8221; The light changed, and we walked across the street. &#8220;Do you know the powers of 2 from 1 to 20? The first 20 elements? The Theory of Relativity?&#8221; &#8220;Do you know how to change a tyre?&#8221; He retorted. &#8221;I&#8217;ve done it a few times. &#8220;What about how to get a girlfriend?&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;re one to ask.&#8221; &#8220;At least I don&#8217;t turn to mush when they talk to me.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s a lie and you know it! You&#8217;re worse than me!&#8221; As we arrived at the next set of lights, my friend continued pushing the button. &#8221;I&#8217;ll wave to you at my Nobel Prize ceremony.&#8221; I said. &#8221;I&#8217;ll talk to you later.&#8221; &#8220;Asshole!&#8221; he shouted at me. &#8220;Proud of it!&#8221; I shouted back, walking into the building.</p>
