    <p>I&#8217;m going to keep this short, it&#8217;s Sunday nearing 10:30pm and I think I&#8217;m coming down with Monday-itis.</p>

<p>This is not a bad Wizard commercial, it&#8217;s simply a suggestion.</p>

<p>PHP is already taught in schools around the country, and most likely around the world. What I don&#8217;t see is any support for Ruby on Rails in schools or TAFE colleges, which sucks. Ruby on Rails is a very easy-to-learn language and a vast majority of the commands are written in plain english. Compare:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8217;PHP&#8217;</span> mysql_query(&#8220;SELECT * FROM <code>blogs</code> WHERE <code>user_id</code> = &#8216;1&#8217; ORDER BY <code>id</code> DESC&#8221;) <span>/code</span></p>

<p>with:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8217;Ruby on Rails&#8217;</span> Blog.find_by_user_id(1, :order =&gt; &#8220;id DESC&#8221;) <span>/code</span></p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s better examples out there than just that. It&#8217;s a beautiful language that students would enjoy. So why not teach it in schools and TAFE? Have a whole TAFE course devoted to Ruby and Rails. Now that would be worth it.</p>
