        <p>A few months ago monopoly.com.au had this voting thing, which allowed anyone and everyone to vote for what should be on the Australian version of the Monopoly game, the more votes the more prestigious the location would be on the board, i.e. The place with the most votes gets Mayfair.</p>

<p>So mr_wizard from <span>url=http://www.valhalla.net.au/forum</span>the Valhalla Forums<span>/url</span> devised a program that voted FOR you over and over again, and voted for Barossa and Adelaide.</p>

<p>So now Barossa and Adelaide have got more votes than NSW, ACT, VIC and QLD combined to take out Mayfair and Park Lane on the new board.</p>

<p>Well done to all parties involved.</p>

<p>Update 9th June 2007: The threads have been removed from the Valhalla forums due to legal advice from Valhalla&#8217;s lawyer. Personally, I don&#8217;t understand anyone who would want to raise a lawsuit against these people who had only good intentions. Any other state could&#8217;ve made the &#8220;program&#8221;, but they didn&#8217;t. We had the initiative and the intelligence to create it, and in the end of the day, that&#8217;s what always wins.</p>

<p>Again, congratulations to the Valhalla members (NOT THE COMMITTEE) who had the initiative to propel our state into pole position.</p>
