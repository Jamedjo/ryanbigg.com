        <p>I received my new laptop last night and after exorcising Vista successfully I am now happily running Ubuntu with a few minor issues. When I right click on the time and click the Adjust button, it presents me with the password dialog box for &quot;time-admin&quot;, I enter my password and nothing happens. Obviously this program is not installed, and I have tried apt-get install time-admin and it&#39;s not in there, but apart from that everything&#39;s smooth.</p>

<p>I received my new motherboard today, an Abit F-I90HD, minus the RAM that needs to go in it to get working. So now I have a motherboard inside my shuttle case with an awesome CPU (E6600) and graphics card (8800GTS), but no RAM. Tomorrow&#39;s a RAM shopping day. </p>

<p>I also have a motherboard not in any case, with CPU, RAM, on-board graphics , a spare IDE cable and a case to put it in, so tomorrow I&#39;m going to put the components in a spare case.</p>

<p>As for my old computer (which really isn&#39;t that old), I&#39;m selling the parts. There&#39;s a motherboard (Gigabite GA-K8NS-Pro) with an AMD Sempron 3100+, one DDR2 333 stick of 512mb RAM, one DD2 400 stick of 512mb RAM, an nVidia 6600GT and a Creative SB0230 Sound Card. I think my uncle John wanted the video card, but everything else is up for grabs. My brother&#39;s offering me $50 for the motherboard with the CPU, which is ridiculous (I hope you&#39;re reading this Scott).</p>

<p>At the moment only one of the four &quot;computers&quot; in my room is operational, and that&#39;s my laptop. Tomorrow&#39;s going to be fun. Goodbye weekend.</p>
