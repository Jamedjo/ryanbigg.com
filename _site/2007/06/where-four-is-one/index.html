        <p>I received my new laptop last night and after exorcising Vista successfully I am now happily running Ubuntu with a few minor issues. When I right click on the time and click the Adjust button, it presents me with the password dialog box for &#8220;time-admin&#8221;, I enter my password and nothing happens. Obviously this program is not installed, and I have tried apt-get install time-admin and it&#8217;s not in there, but apart from that everything&#8217;s smooth.</p>

<p>I received my new motherboard today, an Abit F-I90HD, minus the RAM that needs to go in it to get working. So now I have a motherboard inside my shuttle case with an awesome CPU (E6600) and graphics card (8800GTS), but no RAM. Tomorrow&#8217;s a RAM shopping day.</p>

<p>I also have a motherboard not in any case, with CPU, RAM, on-board graphics , a spare IDE cable and a case to put it in, so tomorrow I&#8217;m going to put the components in a spare case.</p>

<p>As for my old computer (which really isn&#8217;t that old), I&#8217;m selling the parts. There&#8217;s a motherboard (Gigabite GA-K8NS-Pro) with an AMD Sempron 3100+, one DDR2 333 stick of 512mb RAM, one DD2 400 stick of 512mb RAM, an nVidia 6600GT and a Creative SB0230 Sound Card. I think my uncle John wanted the video card, but everything else is up for grabs. My brother&#8217;s offering me $50 for the motherboard with the CPU, which is ridiculous (I hope you&#8217;re reading this Scott).</p>

<p>At the moment only one of the four &#8220;computers&#8221; in my room is operational, and that&#8217;s my laptop. Tomorrow&#8217;s going to be fun. Goodbye weekend.</p>
