        <p>For those of you that don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s a show out called &#8220;Pimp My Ride!&#8221;. On the show, people give their cars to a group of pros (Xzibit and his crew) and they pimp out the ride, adding overkill entertainment systems and generally making the rides look sweet.</p>

<p>My mum&#8217;s friend Charmaine was having computer troubles a while back, I thought I would be nice and go over there and check it out and, hopefully, fix the issue. The Computer, and I use that term very loosely, was running Windows 98. 98 was released in, you guessed it, 1998, making it nine years old.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s about 90 years in real life. It&#8217;s old. It&#8217;s fragile. It whines at everything. It&#8217;s ugly.</p>

<p>To top it off, the computer is running on 200mhz with 32mb of RAM. It has a freakin&#8217; turbo button for God&#8217;s sake! I suppose I should mention now that she&#8217;s on dial-up too.</p>

<p>Now if you look at <span>url=/img/pimpmycase/old-case-back.jpg</span>the back of the case<span>/url</span> you will notice many things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The case is U shaped, meaning the top and both sides come off in one piece.</li>

<li>It&#8217;s old and dusty.</li>

<li>There&#8217;s no PS/2 ports.</li>

<li>There&#8217;s no USB ports.</li>

<li>It has an RS232 port.</li>

<li>It has a parallel port.</li>

<li>It has a serial port.</li>

<li>It makes your eyes water.</li>
</ol>

<p>Originally I brought around my m-robe, thinking I&#8217;ll be able to put some programs on the computer and fix her problems, but without a USB port there was no chance of that happening.</p>

<p>During the first time I was there Charmaine talked about eventually upgrading the computer. She mentioned that she might consider it more after she returned from her trip to Canada.</p>

<p>She returned a few weekends ago and her husband gave me some cash for a new everything. Here&#8217;s what I got her: Motherboard: Asus AM2-940 M2N8-VMX $65 RAM: 1GB DDR2 667 5300 $45 Monitor: Viewsonic 17&#8221; VA703B 8ms $215 Power Supply: 550 Max. SHAW PSU $25 Case: CM Ammo RC-533 $89 Keyboard: Multimedia Slim Keyboard $7 Mouse: Generic Optical Mouse $7 DVD Drive: Samsung 18x Black DVD-RW $38 CPU: AM2-940 x2 Dual Core 3600+ $88 Harddrive: 80GB Maxtor $50</p>

<p>Total: $629.00 Budget: $650.00</p>

<p>I only got the CPU because they were out of the 3200s and I didn&#8217;t want to wait another week for them to order in the parts and go to the trouble of having to go down there again.</p>

<p>This is a whole system and that&#8217;s an awesome price. Now for a very-near bleeding edge kit you&#8217;d pay something like $2.5k.</p>

<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s some pics of the new case and associated other things at <span>url=/img/pimpmycase</span>Pimp My Case<span>/url</span>. Enjoy.</p>
