        <small>08 Jun 2007</small><br>
        <p>I was on the train last night coming from Adelaide to my station and around Nurlutta (about 6 stops away from station) this Aboriginal guy gets on. Instantly this smell infiltrates my nostrils and I fight back the urge to show the guy what I ate for lunch. The worst part is he sat across from me. He mumbled a few things and I completely ignored him.</p>

<p>BUT THIS SMELL WAS UNHOLY. Score +1 for proof there isn&#8217;t a God. Think of everything bad you&#8217;ve ever smelt and concentrate it on one person. I am not over-exaggerating. This is what he smelt like, everything unholy and more.</p>

<p>So I moved one seat up so I could be closer to the door and get the fresh air faster than anyone else in the train. I tried to slow my breathing, holding my breath and so on, but it kept coming back. When the door would open I would subtly lean towards the door and take long deep breaths of the lovely fresh air.</p>

<p>The worst part is that when I got off the train, I could still smell it faintly on my jumper.</p>

<p>It should be a criminal offense, classified under the bio-weapon law umbrella, it was DEVASTATING. I can not stress that enough.</p>

<p>How can people even get to that stage? How can people even let other people get to that stage? Wouldn&#8217;t they notice <em>something</em>?</p>
<hr />
<p>I know this is getting too much of a habit, putting two blogs in one post, but what are you going to do about it?</p>

<p>I ordered some computer parts for my computer and a friend&#8217;s computer, from <span>url=http://msy.com.au</span>a certain computer store<span>/url</span>. WARNING WEBSITE MAY DESTROY ALL HOPE. It was a clear list of what I wanted, and I assumed they would just email me back and tell me when they were ready to be picked up. No such event occurred, so I phoned them up yesterday and was told that they don&#8217;t hold parts for people for more than 2 days. They could&#8217;ve at least told me that in an email, but no response. This is poor customer service, and I&#8217;m considering taking my money (a lot of it) somewhere else.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I ordered:</p>

<p>Friend&#8217;s Computer Motherboard: Asus M2N8 CPU: AN2 Sempron 3000+ RAM: 1gb-667 Generic Monitor: 17&#8221; Viewsonic VA703B-8ms Power Supply: SHAW 550W Case: Coolermaster Ammo RC533 Keyboard: Slim Black-Sliver Keyboard Mouse: USB Optical</p>

<p>Parts for mine: CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 Graphics Card: 640MB 8800GTS Leadtek</p>

<p>That&#8217;s about $1,000 right there. So now I have to re-order all that crap in, I might stop by their store today and verbally order it.</p>
