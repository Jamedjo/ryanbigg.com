            <small>18 Jun 2007</small><br>
            <p>On Friday afternoon at work I ran into an error 21 on one of the computers I had just installed Ubuntu onto. I googled what it meant and it said &quot;device not found&quot;. So I wracked my brain (and google) during the spare moments of my weekend because it bothers me when I get a problem that I can&#39;t solve, and I couldn&#39;t find a good solution where I went &quot;That must be it!&quot;. Also on this same computer I couldn&#39;t get the 7.04-desktop CD to launch into X, it was scrolling the screen with -bash: /dev/null permission denied errors, which the disk did not do on any other computer that I installed it with.</p>

<p>Today at work I downloaded the absolute bare-minimum installer for Ubuntu and actually got that to boot AND install, and I was very happy about that. Then after the install I still had a big ugly grin on my face, thinking I&#39;m top-shit and this bloody error message pops up, AGAIN! I threw the pen that I was spinning on my fingers across the desk and paced to my desk and back again. </p>

<p>Ran my hands through my hair and an abstract piece of a post I was reading on the weekends came to me. It had mentioned something about checking the cables and the drives making sure that they were set to master/slave and so on. But I wouldn&#39;t have that issue because the only hard drive in this machine was a SATA drive, which automatically detects(?) the configuration. Then I thought I would open the box up and make sure of that, so I went to the other building, grabbed a screwdriver, opened the case up and spotted the SIX sata connectors on the motherboard. I thought if I switched the cable over to another one, say from SATA 1 to SATA 2, it&#39;s something I haven&#39;t tried and it might work.</p>

<p>I switched it over, left the sides off and booted, and saw the wonderful &quot;Press ESC to go into menu&quot; of grub.</p>

<p>And then I saw another error! Something to do with IRQ, and apparently suffixing the kernel line in the bootloader with &quot;irqpoll&quot; fixes it, and so I did. Ubuntu is now running awesomely on that PC.</p>

<p>So in short:
Try swapping over the cable to another connector on the motherboard.</p>

<p>Also if anyone knows how to get ATi cards working in harmony with Beryl, that would be nice to know. I&#39;ve googled it and tried the examples and it errors, something about texture failing... I&#39;ll try writing down the message tomorrow.</p>
