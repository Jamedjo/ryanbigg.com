        <small>25 Jun 2007</small><br>
        <p>Another work of fiction based on my obsessive need to tell people not to press the damn button over and over again! I suppress it usually.</p>

<p>One day on the way to work I was walking my usual route through town. I walked up to a set of traffic lights and found one of my friends pushing the button over and over again. I walked closer and said, &quot;You know it doesn&#39;t matter how many times you push that button, it isn&#39;t going to change any faster.
&quot;Hi Ryan.&quot; He replied.
&quot;Did you know the energy you put into pushing that button could be better spent increasing your cranial capacity?&quot;
&quot;I do now&quot;, he said, still pushing the button.
&quot;The first time someone pushes the button it inserts a single function into the cycle of the lights, basically telling the &quot;don&#39;t walk&quot; sign at the other end to change to a &quot;walk&quot; sign if the button is pressed. You could press it a billion times, although I don&#39;t think you&#39;d have enough time between light changes.&quot; The light changed, and we walked across the street. &quot;Do you know the powers of 2 from 1 to 20? The first 20 elements? The Theory of Relativity?&quot;
&quot;Do you know how to change a tyre?&quot; He retorted.
&quot;I&#39;ve done it a few times.
&quot;What about how to get a girlfriend?&quot;
&quot;You&#39;re one to ask.&quot;
&quot;At least I don&#39;t turn to mush when they talk to me.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s a lie and you know it! You&#39;re worse than me!&quot;
As we arrived at the next set of lights, my friend continued pushing the button.
&quot;I&#39;ll wave to you at my Nobel Prize ceremony.&quot; I said. &quot;I&#39;ll talk to you later.&quot;
&quot;Asshole!&quot; he shouted at me.
&quot;Proud of it!&quot; I shouted back, walking into the building.</p>
