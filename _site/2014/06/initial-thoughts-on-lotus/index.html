        <small>19 Jun 2014</small><br>
        <p>Following on from my <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2014/06/spree-factories-and-callbacks/">last post</a>, I&#39;ve been experimenting some more with my <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree_poro">spree_poro</a>, and I&#39;ve been looking at how to work with some kind of data store persistence more sophisticated than the <code>Spree::Data</code> constant that I had used previously. I wanted something more sophisticated than running <code>select</code>s over arrays.</p>

<p><a href="http://lotusrb.org">Lotus</a> bills itself as a &quot;complete web framework for Ruby&quot; and also uses the words &quot;simple&quot;, &quot;fast&quot;, and &quot;lightweight&quot;. In my limited experience of only using the <code>Lotus::Model</code> part of the framework, I can say it&#39;s all of those things. <code>Lotus::Model</code> itself is less than 600 lines and my tests (now 50 of them) still run in &lt;0.05 seconds.</p>

<p><code>Lotus::Model</code> departs from the ActiveRecord way of doing things by having four main types of objects: entities, mappers, repositories and adapters. The creator of Lotus (Luca Guida) has <a href="http://lucaguidi.com/2014/04/23/introducing-lotus-model.html">a great post outlining what each of those do</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve added <code>Lotus::Model</code> to spree_poro (in a <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree_poro/tree/lotus">new branch</a>) and I have it persisting zones, tax rates, tax categories and products; not to a database but to memory. It would be very easy for me to switch this over to an SQL database, thanks to how Lotus is designed. </p>

<p>Having the entities separate from the persistence code means there&#39;s a clear separation between the business logic of the entities and the persistence logic of the repositories. If I want to test that finding tax rates based on an order&#39;s tax zone works, I no longer test that on the <code>Spree::TaxRate</code> model. Instead, that responsibility falls to the <code>Spree::TaxRateRepository</code>, and so <a href="https://github.com/radar/spree_poro/blob/fac4921d87c6a047e8b2df380137f3866cac2442/spec/spree/repositories/tax_rate_spec.rb">that is where it&#39;s tested</a>. This means that I could even get away with stubbing <code>Spree::TaxRateRepository.match</code> in the normal <code>TaxRate</code> specs to return some plain Ruby objects, and those tests do not need to care about any persistence layer at all.</p>

<p>I am very interested to see how this whole Lotus thing pans out. It&#39;s very easy to understand at this point in time, other than that I can&#39;t work out how to properly do polymorphic associations (as is necessary for promotions within Spree, sadly). Perhaps that would be a feature that comes eventually to Lotus, or we re-architect the way Spree is designed to work more with Lotus.</p>
