        <p><strong>Last updated: Saturday 31st January 2014</strong></p>

<p><strong>This beginner&#39;s guide will set your machine up with Ruby 2.2.0 using chruby+ruby-install and Rails 4.2.0 and is specifically written for a <em>development</em> environment on Ubuntu 14.04, but will probably work on many other operating systems, including older / newer versions of Ubuntu and Debian. YMMV.</strong></p>

<h2>Under no circumstance should you install Ruby, Rubygems or any Ruby-related packages from apt-get. This system is out-dated and leads to major headaches. Avoid it for Ruby-related packages. We do Ruby, we know what&#39;s best. Trust us.</h2>

<p>This guide will cover installing a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install"><strong>ruby-install</strong></a>: a very lightweight way to install multiple Rubies on the same box.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby"><strong>chruby</strong></a>: a way to easily switch between those Ruby installs</li>
<li><strong>Ruby 2.2.0</strong>: at the time of writing the newest current stable release of Ruby.</li>
<li><strong>Bundler</strong>: a package dependency manager used in the Ruby community</li>
<li><strong>Rails 4.2.0</strong>: at the time of writing the newest current stable release of Rails.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of this guide, you will have these things installed and have some very, very easy ways to manage gem dependencies for your different applications / libraries, as well as having multiple Ruby versions installed and usable all at once.</p>

<p>We assume you have <code>sudo</code> access to your machine, and that you have an understanding of the basic concepts of Ruby, such as &quot;What is RubyGems?&quot; and more importantly &quot;How do I turn this computer-thing on?&quot;. This knowledge can be garnered by reading the first chapter of <a href="https://manning.com/black2">any Ruby book</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a good Rails book, I wrote one called <a href="http://manning.com/bigg2">Rails 4 in Action</a>.</p>

<h3>Housekeeping</h3>

<p>First of all, we&#39;re going to run <code>sudo apt-get update</code> so that we have the latest sources on our box so that we don&#39;t run into any package-related issues, such as not being able to install some packages.</p>

<p>Next, we&#39;ll run another command which will install the essential building tools that will be used to install Ruby:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre></div>
<p>And now we&#39;re ready to install ruby-install.</p>

<h3>ruby-install</h3>

<p>The installation instructions can be found <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install#install">on the README of ruby-install</a>, but I&#39;ll repeat them here so you don&#39;t have to go over there:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">wget -O ruby-install-0.5.0.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install/archive/v0.5.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ruby-install-0.5.0.tar.gz
cd ruby-install-0.5.0/
sudo make install
</code></pre></div>
<p>First we fetch the ruby-install file, extract it into a directory, then make it. You can verify that these steps have worked by running the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ruby-install -V
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you see this, then you&#39;ve successfully installed ruby-install:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby-install: 0.5.0
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Ruby</h3>

<p>Our next step is to install Ruby itself, which we can do with this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby-install ruby 2.2.0
</code></pre></div>
<p>This command will take a couple of minutes, so grab your $DRINKOFCHOICE and go outside or something. Once it&#39;s done, we&#39;ll have Ruby 2.2.0 installed. In order to use this Ruby version, we&#39;ll need to install chruby as well. The instructions <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby#install">can be found in chruby&#39;s README</a> too, but I will reproduce them here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">wget -O chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/archive/v0.3.9.tar.gz
tar -xzvf chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz
cd chruby-0.3.9/
sudo make install
</code></pre></div>
<p>After this has been installed, we&#39;ll need to load chruby automatically, which we can do by adding these lines to <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh
source /usr/local/share/chruby/auto.sh
</code></pre></div>
<p>In order for this to take effect, we&#39;ll need to source that file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">. ~/.bashrc
</code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, opening a new terminal tab/window will do the same thing.</p>

<p>To verify that chruby is installed and has detected our Ruby installation, run <code>chruby</code>. If you see this, then it&#39;s working:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby-2.2.0
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we need to make that Ruby the default Ruby for our system, which we can do by creating a new file called <code>~/.ruby-version</code> with this content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby-2.2.0
</code></pre></div>
<p>This file tells <code>chruby</code> which Ruby we want to use by default. To change the ruby version that we&#39;re using, we can run <code>chruby ruby-2.2.0</code> for example -- assuming that we have Ruby 2.2.0 installed first!</p>

<p>Did this work? Let&#39;s find out by running <code>ruby -v</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby 2.2.0p0 (2014-12-25 revision 49005) [x86_64-linux]
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Rails</h3>

<p>Now that we have a version of Ruby installed, we can install Rails. Because our Ruby is installed to our home directory, we don&#39;t need to use that nasty <code>sudo</code> to install things; we&#39;ve got write-access! To install the Rails gem we&#39;ll run this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">gem install rails -v 4.2.0 --no-rdoc --no-ri
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will install the <code>rails</code> gem and the multitude of gems that it and its dependencies depend on, including Bundler.</p>

<h3>MySQL</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re planning on using the <code>mysql2</code> gem for your application then you&#39;ll want to install the <code>libmysqlclient-dev</code> package before you do that. Without it, you&#39;ll get an error when the gem tries to compile its native extensions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing mysql2:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

</code></pre></div>
<p>Install this package using <code>sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev</code>.</p>

<h3>PostgreSQL</h3>

<p>Similar to the <code>mysql2</code> gem&#39;s error above, you&#39;ll also get an error with the <code>pg</code> gem if you don&#39;t have the <code>libpq-dev</code> package installed you&#39;ll get this error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing pg:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

    /home/ryan/.rubies/ruby-2.2.0/bin/ruby extconf.rb

*** extconf.rb failed ***

libraries and/or headers.  Check the mkmf.log file for more details.  You may
need configuration options.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Install this package using <code>sudo apt-get install libpq-dev</code>.</p>

<h3>SQLite3</h3>

<p>Just like MySQL and PostgreSQL before it, attempting to install the <code>sqlite3</code> gem will result in this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

    /home/ryan/.rubies/ruby-2.2.0/bin/ruby extconf.rb
checking for sqlite3.h... no
sqlite3.h is missing. Try &#39;port install sqlite3 +universal&#39;,
&#39;yum install sqlite-devel&#39; or &#39;apt-get install libsqlite3-dev&#39;
and check your shared library search path (the
location where your sqlite3 shared library is located).
*** extconf.rb failed ***
Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary
libraries and/or headers.  Check the mkmf.log file for more details.  You may
need configuration options.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Fix this issue by running <code>sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev</code>.</p>

<h3>JavaScript Runtime</h3>

<p>Rails requires a JavaScript runtime to run its precompile step for the asset pipeline. If you attempt to run <code>rake assets:precompile</code> without one of these, you&#39;ll see this message:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable: Could not find a JavaScript runtime. See https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs for a list of available runtimes.
</code></pre></div>
<p>To fix this error install <code>nodejs</code>, which comes with a JavaScript runtime:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">sudo apt-get install nodejs
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Fin</h3>

<p>And that&#39;s it! Now you&#39;ve got a Ruby environment you can use to write your (first?) Rails application in with such minimal effort. A good read after this would be the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org'>official guides for Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>

<p>The combination of chruby and ruby-install is such a powerful tool and comes in handy for day-to-day Ruby development. Use it, and not the packages from apt to live a life of development luxury.</p>

<h3>Postscript</h3>

<p>A previous version of this guide used RVM. RVM has overtime become bloated and unwieldy. There are many features of RVM that developers simply don&#39;t use, and so using a simpler solution is a better way of doing things as it will lead to less confusion. For instance, RVM provides gemsets which is a feature that is no longer necessary with the advent of Bundler. Even if you don&#39;t want to use Bundler (i.e. you&#39;re crazy) then there&#39;s smaller more specifically-targeted tools for that, such as <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/ohmygems">ohmygems</a>. RVM&#39;s days as the leading way to install Ruby are over, and this guide has been updated to reflect that. There are better tools.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve opted for chruby+ruby-install in this guide because they&#39;ve consistently worked for me and are very, very easy to install. I know of a great many other people who have also used, and continue to use, these tools and I&#39;ve not heard of any of them complaining. Therefore I can only wholeheartedly recommend them to the readers of this post.</p>
