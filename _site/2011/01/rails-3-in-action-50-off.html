            <h1>This is a very old blog post. The discount code is no longer valid.</h1>

<p>From now until the 23rd of February, <a href='http://manning.com/katz/'>Rails 3 in Action</a> is 50% off when you use the code <strong>rails350</strong>. This means you get the book for a discounted price of only $17.50.</p>

<p>Rails 3 in Action is a new breed of programming book; one that takes you on a journey of how you would develop an application in the real world, one step at a time. The book comes out of a collaboration between Yehuda Katz and Ryan Bigg (me1).</p>

<p>About this book</p>

<p>Rails 3 in Action begins by introducing Ruby on Rails and the basic underlying concepts. Right off the bat you&#39;ll be developing an application and learning how Rails works. Then we take a short break from Rails, delving instead into two of the core foundations of the book: Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). We extensively use these practices throughout the book in order to build a maintainable application, just like Rails shops worldwide operate.</p>

<p>From the get go you&#39;re taught how to develop using tests, which really pays off in the end for any project, allowing you to write code that breaks less often.</p>

<p>Chapters 3-17 cover developing a ticket tracking application, one feature at a time. We cover things such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>RSpec &amp; Cucumber</li>
<li>The basics of a maintainable Rails application</li>
<li>RESTful routing</li>
<li>Authentication &amp; Authorization Systems</li>
<li>Sending email</li>
<li>Writing an API</li>
</ul>

<p>There&#39;s more than that though! Check out the chapter listing to see what other exciting topics are covered.</p>

<p>Chapters 18-23 go through the more advanced sections of Rails such as how to build a Railtie (a Ruby library that ties in with Rails) and how to build mini-applications that can be plugged into other applications, called engines.</p>

<p>Rails 3 -- and the evolving ecosystem around it -- brings a new generation of Ruby on Rails development, whilst still staying familiar to those who&#39;ve used previous versions. This book is a must-read for everybody who&#39;s interested in Rails 3, from new people all the way up to experienced developers, you are guaranteed to learn something by reading this awesome book.</p>

<p>So use the <strong>rails350</strong> discount code today to get 50% off on <a href='http://manning.com/katz/'>Rails 3 in Action</a>.</p>
