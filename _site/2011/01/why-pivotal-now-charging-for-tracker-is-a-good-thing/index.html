        <small>20 Jan 2011</small><br>
        <p>Today, Pivotal Labs has announced that they <a href='http://pivotallabs.com/users/dan/blog/articles/1537-introducing-pivotal-tracker-pricing'>will start charging people to use (Pivotal) Tracker</a>, but only if their project is not public, for-profit or not for education. As they explain in the article, they&#8217;ve been working on Tracker now for 5 years.</p>

<p>5 years (or around 1,826 days) is immensely long time for a <em>Rails</em> project to have been around. 5 years ago, Rails was at 0.9.4, very nearly at 0.9.5. This project was before Rails was mainstream. The Pivotal Labs crew have done a tremendous job on it, constantly upgrading its features and most recently overhauling the UI to something very, very hot. For 5 years, it&#8217;s been free to use for anyone and everyone, but now they would like to start charging for it and I think this is a great idea. With the Pivotal Labs team now electing to transform Tracker to a paid service, they&#8217;ll be able to dedicate more people to work on it and maintain it, leading to a better experience overall.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s quite a lot of people who are already using the service (including myself) and love it. $50 a month for 10 collaborators is a good price point and one I&#8217;m sure any company I&#8217;d work for would be willing to pay. Pivotal Tracker has played, ahem, a pivotal role in many projects I have been on and it&#8217;s only fair that we continue to use their service and pay their toll to show our respect for 5 years of good, hard work that they&#8217;ve put into it. There&#8217;s 180,000 users (an astonishing figure for a (previously) non-commercial software), of Pivotal Tracker today, so they must be doing something right.</p>

<p>Please don&#8217;t abandon Pivotal Tracker now because they&#8217;re asking for money. How would you feel if you worked on something for that long only for the people to abandon you? You&#8217;d feel used by those people. Support Pivotal, as they have provided a kick ass project management tool (publicly) for near on two and a half years now.</p>
