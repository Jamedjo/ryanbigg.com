<p><code>bundle update</code> is a command provided by the Bundler gem which will update <em>all</em> your gem dependencies to their latest versions. Providing you have a <code>Gemfile.lock</code> pre-existing, running <code>bundle install</code> will only install the versions specified in the <code>Gemfile.lock</code> and will complain that you have incompatible versions:</p>

<pre><code>Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem &quot;activesupport&quot;:
  In snapshot (Gemfile.lock):
    activesupport (3.0.0)

  In Gemfile:
    rails (= 3.0.3) depends on
      activesupport (= 3.0.3)

Running `bundle update` will rebuild your snapshot from scratch, using only
the gems in your Gemfile, which may resolve the conflict.</code></pre>

<p>This command advises you to run <code>bundle update</code> which &#8220;will rebuild your snapshot from scratch&#8221;, or in layman&#8217;s terms: throw out the <code>Gemfile.lock</code> file and start again, finding <em>newer</em> versions of gems if they are available and building a bundle for those.</p>

<p>Beneath is an example of just this happening, and an argument as to why you should run it, but carefully.</p>

<h3 id='alexs_tale'>Alex&#8217;s Tale</h3>

<p>There&#8217;s <a href='http://optimisdev.com/posts/don-t-ever-run-bundle-update'>a post by Alex from OptimisDev</a> that basically says: &#8220;Don&#8217;t even run bundle update&#8221;. That&#8217;s even the title of the post. His argument is that by running <code>bundle update</code> his I18n version changed from <code>0.4.0</code> to <code>0.5.0</code> which caused his translations to break. This is because in <code>i18n 0.5.0</code> the translation syntax has changed <em>from</em> <code>\{\{key\}\}</code> <em>to</em> <code>%{key}</code>. Why did this happen? He was using the <a href='http://rubygems.org/gems/formtastic/versions/1.2.3.beta'><code>formtastic</code> gem</a> which had specified a dependency on <code>i18n</code> of <code>&gt;= 0.4.0</code> which will install any version of i18n that is <code>0.4.0</code> or greater, a category that <code>i18n 0.5.0</code> with its breaking API changes falls into.</p>

<h3 id='a_story_on_gem_versioning'>A story on gem versioning</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, there&#8217;s three parts of a version for a gem: the major, the minor and the tiny. For example, Rails right now has a major version of 3, a minor version of 0 and a tiny version of 3, making the full version <code>3.0.3</code> currently.</p>

<p>The &#8220;rule&#8221; (or perhaps it&#8217;s more of a guideline) of gem versioning is that any subsequent releases for the <em>same</em> minor version, but a newer, higher tiny version number should fix any bugs that existed in the previous version, without breaking any functionality. Therefore you should be able to have a gem dependency like this in your <code>Gemfile</code> without any fear that it would break:</p>

<pre><code>gem &#39;rails&#39;, &#39;~&gt; 3.0.0&#39;</code></pre>

<p>The <code>~&gt;</code> part of the version indicates that we want the latest version in the series that we&#8217;ve specified. Because we&#8217;ve specified a major, minor and tiny version here, we&#8217;ll get the latest tiny release of the <code>3.0</code> series (<code>3.0.3</code> at current writing) when we run <code>bundle install</code>. In a new tiny release, there should be <em>no breaking changes</em>, only patches. Therefore, specifying versions like this is considered the safest method.</p>

<p>For minor and major releases, things can be broken and so developers should take care when running any kind of task that updates their gems to the latest version.</p>

<h3 id='when_gem_dependencies_go_bad'>When gem dependencies go bad</h3>

<p>In Alex&#8217;s case, formtastic has declared it depends on <code>i18n &gt;= 0.4.0</code> which is how <em>gem dependencies go bad</em>. In new minor or major releases of <code>i18n</code>, it&#8217;s just about guaranteed that shit will be broke, and that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s going to be installed when an unwitting person runs <code>bundle update</code>. As gem authors (and I&#8217;m probably guilty of this myself), we should be specifying <code>~&gt;</code> for their own gem dependencies. And we as application developers should be doing for our own gem dependencies in our <code>Gemfile</code> files. This is the way to be safe against breaking changes from a new minor or major gem version. I&#8217;m not saying that <em>every</em> new major/minor release has breaking changes, but rather to be wary when you&#8217;re upgrading.</p>

<h3 id='staying_safe'>Staying safe</h3>

<p>If we follow these simple guidelines then we can live a peaceful life of Gem Dependency Heaven instead of Gem Dependency Hell (think pre-Bundler days).</p>

<p>Whilst it&#8217;s probably not a good idea to run <code>bundle update</code> (and Alex used stronger wording with the &#8220;ever&#8221; word), it&#8217;s still useful in some contexts. Recently, David Chelimsky released a new tiny version of rspec-rails (2.4.1) which fixed a single bug. If I had <code>gem &#39;rspec-rails&#39;, &#39;~&gt; 2.4.0&#39;</code> and had <code>rspec-rails 2.4.0</code> installed but wanted to use the newest gem, I could update it by running a simple command:</p>

<pre><code>bundle update rspec-rails</code></pre>

<p>This command updates the <code>rspec-rails</code> gem and its dependencies to satisfy their latest version specifications, leaving every other gem untouched.</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s <em>potentially unsafe</em> to run <code>bundle update</code> because new versions of gems could break your application, but this should be a rare occasion because your gem versions should be specified as <code>~&gt; &lt;a tiny version&gt;</code>, and if the authors of the gems are as smart as they should be, tiny versions should only contain bug fixes.</p>
