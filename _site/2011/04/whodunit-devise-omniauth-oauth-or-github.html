        <small>11 Apr 2011</small><br>
        <p>(If it wasn&#39;t obvious enough: my previous blog post about Rails 3.1 in Action is an April Fools joke. If Rails 3.1 is released before Rails 3 in Action goes to print, Rails 3 in Action will most likely contain the 3.1 updates necessary)</p>

<p>I&#39;m currently writing what is the final chapter in Rails 3 in Action and I&#39;m pretty excited about it. It&#39;s the &quot;Alternative Authentication&quot; chapter, Chapter 14. It&#39;s not to say there are 14 chapters in the book... there aren&#39;t. There&#39;s seventeen chapters two, maybe three appendicies. This happens to be the last chapter I have to work on and its number is 14.</p>

<p>When I begun writing the book back near the end of April last year I sketched out the idea of this chapter thinking it would be a good thing to show people because a lot of people seem to struggle (myself included) in setting up alternative means of authentication using OAuth (and OpenID, etc.) providers. I personally had no idea what I was going to do write in it at that point in time, but that&#39;s how I&#39;ve been writing the book thus far and it&#39;s turned out pretty alright I hear.</p>

<p>Then a couple of months ago, <a href='http://github.com/intridea/omniauth'>OmniAuth</a> came onto the scene. My god, it was like Christmas came early. It claimed to simplify the authentication process of alternative services down to its most basic forms. I distinctly remembering trying it out almost immediately and staring in starry-eyed wonder at the process as it worked seamlessly with Twitter and GitHub. That was back in November and I had other chapters I was working on then, like Chapter 11.</p>

<p>With the final chapters of the book I&#39;ve adopted a &quot;work on whatever you feel like&quot; stance with them, as they aren&#39;t required to be done in any particular order. For example, I did the &quot;Engines&quot; chapter (16) before I did the chapter on &quot;Basic performance enhancements&quot; (15) and &quot;Rack applications&quot; (17). It just so happened that Chapter 14 got left to last.</p>

<p>So I worked on it beginning the middle of last week, implementing basic Twitter authentication and writing a pretty decent first draft of it over the next two days. Then on Friday I accidentally deleted my work for the chapter up to about the 20th line in the document (from somewhere around the 350 range) when I ran one of my publishing scripts over it. I had no backups, and it wasn&#39;t version controlled. I felt like an idiot.</p>

<p>Over this past weekend I&#39;ve re-written all of what I did with Twitter on the Friday night and Saturday (which was a poor day of writing, was too distractable). Sunday morning I revised the section and Sunday afternoon I begun in my attempt to use GitHub. That&#39;s when things stopped flowing.</p>

<p>When I write the book I attempt things in the ticketee application first and then just copy over the working code samples from that into the book. It&#39;s a little bit of a laborious process, but it&#39;s worked so far (I know there&#39;s better ways, I just don&#39;t have the time to do them). When I attempted GitHub authentication using Devise 1.2.1&#39;s OmniAuth (0.2.1) authentication support it told me &quot;Invalid credentials&quot;.</p>

<p>I was incredulous. How could I stuff up something so basic when it worked so well with Twitter? I spent the afternoon calling Devise nasty names both out loud and on Twitter and went to bed early, defeated. I could not for the life of me figure this out.</p>

<p>I awoke after a terrible night&#39;s sleep (the kind you have when the problem is right there and you know the solution is there, but isn&#39;t). I dreamed mostly of code. I awoke feeling strangely refreshed at 6am and did the usual morning things before attempting the problem again.</p>

<p>I made sure I had the absolute latest version of Devise and OmniAuth. I did. </p>

<p>I made sure I was able to create a new GitHub application and duplicate these conditions, both on Ticketee and on a brand new Rails application. I was able to do that too.</p>

<p>I was still utterly convinced it was something Devise was doing. I had pointed my finger squarely at it for the past 9 awake hours and why should I question my opinion then? I wanted to make extra sure, so I tried <em>another</em> brand new Rails 3 application but didn&#39;t use Devise. I used straight OmniAuth (thanks to <a href='http://railscasts.com/episodes/241-simple-omniauth'>Ryan Bates&#39; superb Railscast on it</a>) and it still didn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Blast! My prime suspect was no longer prime, nor a suspect! So it was something to do with OmniAuth then, perhaps. I found an application called <a href='http://github.com/markusproske/omniauth_pure'><code>omniauth_pure</code></a> which claimed to offer a basic example of OmniAuth authentication. I tried this and...</p>

<p>It worked! The damn thing worked. So what was different? Well, I noticed that they were using an older version of the oa-oauth gem (v0.2.0) where I was using v0.3.0. I suspected a problem had been generated between these two versions, and my finger was then pointed at OmniAuth as being the source of all my trouble.</p>

<p>I cloned <code>git://github.com/intridea/omniauth</code> into the <code>vendor/gems/omniauth</code> folder of my application, update the <code>Gemfile</code> accordingly, and tried it again and it was still broken. Ok, it still looked like an omniauth problem. So I did a <a href='https://gist.github.com/912916'>git bisect</a> (saviour!) and came up with a commit by none other than Michael Bleigh himself: <code>72b9b619bbc2a41b61ee4ec108bdfa4dc16838f9</code>.</p>

<p>Aha! This commit bumped the oauth2 dependency and, according to <code>git bisect</code>, that commit is to blame for my source of woe. But it&#39;s not, because it&#39;s innocently bumping a gem version up, it&#39;s actually oauth2.</p>

<p>So my finger now switches for a second time to the oauth2 gem. I clone this into the <code>vendor/gems/oauth2</code> directory, update the <code>Gemfile</code> and do a git bisect on it. The <a href='https://gist.github.com/912926'>results</a> indicated a commit that I could blame for all my troubles.</p>

<p><a href='https://github.com/intridea/oauth2/commit/1dbfe18af997c45a69fdea29192f599f20d80879'>This commit.</a></p>

<p>It dutifully changes a small detail, the <code>@token\_param</code> to be the <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-10#section-5.1.2'>OAuth2 draft 10 specified (in section 5.1.2)</a> &quot;oauth_token&quot; rather than &quot;access_token&quot;. This means that all providers who have updated to this draft specification are now supported by the oauth2 gem but those who have not, <em>like GitHub</em>, are left behind.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentleman, after my long story, let me present to you Exhibit A, direct from <a href='http://develop.github.com/p/oauth.html'>GitHub&#39;s OAuth documentation</a>:</p>

<p><img src='https://img.skitch.com/20110411-qn2ps6uckm4deq851ubydjtf71.png' /></p>

<p>A keen eye, keener than my own, would notice here that the parameter is not called &quot;oauth_token&quot; as is being supplied by the oauth2 gem now as of the afore-mentioned commit, but rather it&#39;s still called &quot;access_token&quot;.</p>

<p>I submit to you that GitHub&#39;s OAuth 2 specification is broken, but the <a href='http://support.github.com/discussions/site/3398-your-oauth-implementation-is-broken-but-heres-a-fix'>fix is extremely easy</a> and only GitHub (or a hack to oauth2) can fix it.</p>

<p>That was quite a lot of frustration caused by that one small little detail. This was very fun to track down and the high I got from solving it was well worth it. It&#39;s one of the things I enjoy most as a programmer is solving a difficult bug.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It was later <a href='https://github.com/intridea/oauth2/issues/44#issuecomment-993151'>found out</a> that <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-15.txt'>Draft 15 of the OAuth2 Specification</a> actually reverts that change, making it back to <code>access\_token</code>, meaning that the <code>oauth2</code> gem is technically wrong in this case.</p>

<p>The problem itself won&#39;t be fixed until the OAuth2 specification solidifies or <code>oauth2</code> hacks around it to support different services calling this parameter by different names.</p>
