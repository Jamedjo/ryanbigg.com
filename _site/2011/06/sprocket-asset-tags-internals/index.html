        <p>Yesterday&#39;s post and twitter bitching caught the eye of our <a href='http://twitter.com/dhh'>fearless leader</a> who basically claimed <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/dhh/status/81987522766450688'>that I&#39;ve not made documentation patches recently</a>. I responded with a small reminder that I&#39;ve done <a href='https://twitter.com/ryanbigg/status/81988004947828736'>some documentation work</a> and went a step further and begun an <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/guides/asset_pipeline.html'>Asset Pipeline Guide</a> because I could. I could have pulled the whole &quot;Don&#39;t you know who I am?!!&quot; faux-lebrity deal, but I thought I would be humble. Append &quot;for a change&quot; to the end of the previous sentence, if you wish.</p>

<p>That was incredibly fun. We should do it again some time. Have your people call my people, we&#39;ll do lunch.</p>

<p>Before all that went down, I created a short (by my standards, anyway) <a href='https://gist.github.com/1032696'>Gist about how the <code>Sprockets::Railtie</code> class is currently set up in Rails</a>. This little Gist begun as short note taking for myself and I thought that maybe other people would find the information helpful, so I formatted it all pretty like.</p>

<p>After the <em>battle of the egos</em> took place, I delved a little deeper into the Sprockets rabbit hole, got defeated by some gnarly code and thought &quot;fuck it dude, let&#39;s go <s>bowling</s> to sleep&quot;. I awoke this morning and delved a little deeper into exactly how all of this magic happens.</p>

<p>This guide now lives as the <a href='https://github.com/radar/guides/blob/master/sprockets.md'>Sprockets Internals Guide</a> on my <a href='http://github.com/radar/guides'>guides</a> repository. Check out both of them. You may learn something.</p>
