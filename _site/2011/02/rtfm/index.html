        <p>A scene that plays out in every single programming languages&#8217; (oh, and let&#8217;s not forget the glorious #gentoo) IRC channel I&#8217;ve come across:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;new_guy&gt; How do I do x?
&lt;old_hat&gt; omg noob RTFM plz</code></pre>

<p>Or something to that degree.</p>

<p>As Yehuda Katz <a href='http://yehudakatz.com/2010/02/09/the-blind-men-and-the-elephant-a-story-of-noobs/'>wrote nearly a year ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  ... the "noob" can stare at "the f***ing manual" all day and simply fail to find something staring him in the face. Importantly, this does not reflect a failing on the part of the new developer.
</blockquote>
<p>When a person enters a channel and asks a question, our immediate reaction should not be one to shout at them to &#8220;RTFM&#8221;, but to point them to the specific point <em>in the manual</em> where they <em>may</em> find their answers. If they don&#8217;t happen to find the answer there, then either spend some time helping them or, if you&#8217;re thinking of something nasty to say, do nothing. Go surreptitiously tweet about it or something (but if you do that, you&#8217;re still a dick). Whatever you do, abusing the person who is coming to you, who is respecting your opinion on the topic, for <em>no apparent reason</em> is just not on.</p>

<p>Ridiculing them will only lead them to hate you, hate the language that they&#8217;re trying so darn hard to learn and they will abandon it. They will tell their friends that the people in the channel are arrogant and unhelpful.</p>

<p>In the Ruby channels, we must be better than #gentoo, better than ##php. We must strive to rise above being &#8220;holier-than-thou&#8221; and instead of getting on our high horse because we know everything we should share that knowledge with those who do not yet possess it.</p>

<p>How else do you expect them to learn?</p>
