        <p>I think <a href='http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber'>Cucumber</a> is great, but not great for everything. Many people (including myself) use it and swear by it. You get to write <em>features</em> in <em>English</em> (or other languages), man. It&#39;s really awesome if you want to show these stories to people who you&#39;re developing for as they can read it and understand it.</p>

<p>I personally feel, in some cases, Cucumber isn&#39;t the right solution. If you&#39;re developing something that has no non-Ruby savvy stakeholder, why would you write it in Cucumber? I personally don&#39;t see the point. It overly complicates things.</p>

<p>Take this example: I want to create a feature for posting a new comment on a post. It would go like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">Feature: Comments
In order to tell the masses what&#39;s on my mind
As a user
I want to post comments on the site

Background:
  Given there is a post:
    | title        | text                         |
    | When to Cuke | I think Cucumber is great... |

Scenario: Creating a comment
  Given I am on the homepage
  When I follow &quot;When to Cuke&quot;
  And I fill in &quot;Text&quot; with &quot;I am posting a comment. Look at me go!&quot;
  And I press &quot;Post Comment&quot;
  Then I should see &quot;I am posting a comment.&quot; within &quot;#comments&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to keep it as simple as I can here, but it should demonstrate the point I am trying to make. The logic of how the &quot;Given there is a post&quot; step is defined something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">Given /^there is a post:$/ do |table|
  hash = table.hashes.first
  @post = Post.create!(hash)
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>Where&#39;s it defined? Well, it could be anywhere. That&#39;s the problem! Usually, I&#39;d define this in a file at <code>features/step_definitions/post_steps.rb</code> because it deals with <code>Post</code> objects, but that&#39;s just me. People have different tastes and therefore, undoubtedly, will do it differently. Maybe I&#39;ve been too mollycoddled by Rails, but this is completely arbitrarily decided by whoever&#39;s writing the feature at the time. It gets to me.</p>

<p>Oh, then what happens if you want to have some kind of association, say you want to add an author to that post, transforming the step into this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">Given there is a post:
  | title        | text                         | author                  |
  | When to Cuke | I think Cucumber is great... | radarlistener@gmail.com |
</code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s an email address. But what does it mean? Well, that behaviour would have to be defined in the step definition, which is &quot;in another castle&quot;.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">Given /^there is a post:$/ do |table|
   hash = table.hashes.first
   hash[&quot;author&quot;] = Factory(:user, :email =&gt; hash[&quot;author&quot;])
   @post = Post.create!(hash)
 end
</code></pre></div>
<p>There&#39;s no way you can specify a pre-existing Ruby object to be a value for one of the keys in the table in Cucumber. Therefore, you have to hack around it like this.</p>

<p>Additional gripe: I&#39;m constantly typing &quot;Given I&quot; and &quot;When I&quot; and &quot;And I&quot;. <strong>Boring</strong>. I&#39;m a programmer, coding a site that programmers will use. Why am I writing it in English?</p>

<h2>Enter: Capybara</h2>

<p>Now let&#39;s see this <em>same</em> test, but written as a Capybara integration test:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">describe &quot;Comments&quot; do
  before do
    Factory(:post, :title =&gt; &quot;When to Cuke&quot;,
                   :text =&gt; &quot;I think Cucumber is great...&quot;,
                   :user =&gt; Factory(:user, :email =&gt; &quot;radarlistener@gmail.com&quot;))
  end

  it &quot;creating a comment&quot; do
    visit root_path
    click_link &quot;When to Cuke&quot;
    fill_in &quot;Text&quot;, :with =&gt; &quot;I am posting a comment. Look at me go!&quot;
    click_button &quot;Post Comment&quot;
    within(&quot;#comments&quot;) do
      page.should have_content(&quot;I am posting a comment. Look at me go!&quot;)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>No bullshit, everything&#39;s there that I need to understand the spec. There are no step definitions. I can &quot;parse&quot; this code much faster in my head than I can with its Cucumber brother, allowing me to be a more productive developer. There&#39;s nothing extra on the lines. No &quot;Given&quot;, no &quot;When&quot;, it just <em>does</em> things. There&#39;s nobody on my team that doesn&#39;t understand this code.</p>

<p>Note also here how I&#39;m able to pass through an object to the <code>user</code> key in the <code>Post</code> factory without having to hack around it.</p>

<p>Simple, elegant and effective. Yes please. Oh, and it&#39;s shorter too. I&#39;m using RSpec + Capybara to develop the <a href='http://github.com/radar/forem'>forem gem</a> (eventual aim: a decent forum engine for Rails 3) and I&#39;m loving it. It just works, and there&#39;s no extraneous syntax in my specs.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re working with people who aren&#39;t technically-inclined then perhaps it would be easier to use Cucumber, as it is the easiest to read. But when working on a team of Ruby developers, developing something internal, I think Capybara is the way to go. If you&#39;re looking for a way to combine the two techniques then I&#39;d recommend taking a look at <a href='http://github.com/cavalle/steak'>cavalle&#39;s steak</a> gem, or <a href='http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2011/acceptance-testing-using-capybaras-new-rspec-dsl/'>this post by Jeff Kreeftmeijer</a>, showing how to do it with straight Capybara.</p>
