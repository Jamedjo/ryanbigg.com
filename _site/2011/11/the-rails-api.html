        <small>14 Nov 2011</small><br>
        <p>Recently, the Rails API got a facelift. Gone is the boring and dull blue four-frame-set API that once was. Now we
have a dual-framed red API instead. The colours are good, I&#39;ll give it that. Take a look at it:</p>

<p><img src='/images/rails-api/original.png' /></p>

<p>Notice anything wrong?</p>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s take away some things until you start thinking it&#39;s wrong. How about we take out that &quot;RDOC_MAIN.rdoc&quot;
string -- both instances -- and we made the version more prominent? We&#39;ll also get rid of the last modified
timestamp, as a date is more friendly to people. Making these simple changes, we&#39;ll get this:</p>

<p><img src='/images/rails-api/title-changes.png'></p>

<p>Right. That&#39;s a little better now. It&#39;s clearer what the purpose of this page is and when it was last updated. We
don&#39;t care that the README is in a file called &quot;RDOC_MAIN.rdoc&quot;, and so we&#39;ve removed it. Simple.</p>

<p>Now what else don&#39;t we need? Well, when we go to the API we&#39;re most likely going to want to find information about
the methods provided by Rails. So why have the README there at all? While it&#39;s a good placeholder for the content,
that&#39;s all it is: a placeholder. The main focus of the API site should be what we want to do on it: search for
things. If you want to read the README, there&#39;s <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails'>better (and more standard) places for that</a>, quite simply.</p>

<p>With the README gone, we&#39;re going to have this gigantic void of empty, useless space. With this change, the main
feature of the API, the searching, is almost hidden up in the top-left hand corner. So let&#39;s make that more
prominent.</p>

<p>Is that menu underneath it really useful? It contains an awfully large amount of items in it. Do people really
care about that? Isn&#39;t searching for something a much easier way to find it? I&#39;d say so.</p>

<p>So we remove the README, we remove the menu, we make the search more prominent. What are we left with?</p>

<p><img src='/images/rails-api/search-box.png' /></p>

<p>The title, the date the API was last updated and a box to search. There&#39;s no mystery to what this box does: it
says &quot;Search&quot; on it. It could also say &quot;Search the Rails API&quot;. Anybody should be able to figure out that you can search the API using this box.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s no button! There doesn&#39;t need to be a button, though. When a person searches, it will autocomplete
their search and show the matching results from the API. You could even go a step further and weight certain
results, so that things like <s><code>ActiveRecord::Base</code></s>, um, excuse me, <code>ActiveRecord::FinderMethods</code>&#39;s <code>find</code>
method appears before <code>ActiveResource::Base</code>.</p>

<p>Further more, you could get a search for &quot;match&quot; to show the routing (<code>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Base</code>)
<code>match</code> method prominently, and the other <code>match</code> (like the one in <code>HTML::Selector</code>) methods less prominently, perhaps in a grey colour instead of black.</p>

<p>Anything wrong with this now? I think not. The API is less confusing and more prominently displays the function
that most people use it for.</p>

<hr>

<p>That&#39;s my vision for the future of the Rails API. I know it probably won&#39;t get to that stage, as there&#39;s large
technical hurdles in the way (such as indexing the entire documentation for Rails into a searchable format), but I
think that it&#39;s still possible.</p>

<p>So this weekend I dove into some <a href='http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/'>Backbone.js</a> with the help
of <a href='http://twitter.com/joeybeninghove'>Joey Beninghove&#39;s</a> <a
href='http://backbonescreencasts.com/'>great Backbone.js screencasts</a> and built this idea. There&#39;s also a bit
of the Twitter Bootstrap in use, which makes things pretty.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called <a href='http://radar.github.com/sume'>Sume</a> and looks like this:</p>

<p><img src='/images/sume.png'></p>

<p>It&#39;s just a proof-of-concept of this Rails API idea, allowing you to search for only a handful of classes and methods at the moment. But it presents it in a neat format.</p>

<p>Ah, and one more thing: it gives you a unique URL for each page, which is something the current Rails API <em>doesn&#39;t
do</em>. When you make a request to <a href='http://radar.github.com/sume/#search/ActiveSupport::Concern'>the link for
ActiveSupport::Concern</a> it actually takes you right to those docs. This makes it easy to link it to other
people.</p>
