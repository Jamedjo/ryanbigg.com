        <a href="/2017/06/current-considered-harmful"><h2>CurrentAttributes considered harmful</h2></a>
        <small>22 Jun 2017</small><br>
        <p>I was made aware of <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/24a864437e845febe91e3646ca008e8dc7f76b56">this commit</a> recently (thanks to Rebecca Skinner) to Rails which introduces what is effectively a global state to Rails applications.</p>

<p>Rather than writing why global state in-general is a bad thing myself, I will instead link you to this <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148108/why-is-global-state-so-evil">excellent question + answer on the Software Engineering Stack Exchange</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very briefly, it makes program state unpredictable.</p>

<p>To elaborate, imagine you have a couple of objects that both use the same global variable. Assuming you&#39;re not using a source of randomness anywhere within either module, then the output of a particular method can be predicted (and therefore tested) if the state of the system is known before you execute the method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implementation also chooses to use <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/24a864437e845febe91e3646ca008e8dc7f76b56#diff-3c3c0f647bc4702f9453c173a707aa06R90">thread-local variables</a> which <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8291218/15245">this answer over on Stack Overflow</a> explains is not a good choice because:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s harder to test them, as you will have to remember to set the thread-local variables when you&#39;re testing out code that uses it</li>
<li>Classes who use thread locals will need knowledge that these objects are not available for them but inside a thread-local variable and this kind of indirection usually breaks the law of demeter</li>
<li>Not cleaning up thread-locals might be an issue if your framework reuses threads (the thread-local variable would be already initiated and code that relies on ||= calls to initialize variables might fail</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to mention that this also violates the well-established <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">Law of Demeter</a> too. Suddenly, <code>Current</code> is available <em>anywhere</em> in your application. Good code is <em>explicit</em> in how it makes data available to its methods / functions. This <code>CurrentAttributes</code> feature is not good code, nor is it making it <em>explicitly clear</em> how <code>Current.user</code> arrives in the model. It is just there &quot;magically&quot;.</p>

<p>I enjoy and have benefited from Rails magic in the past. Some of my favourite features are <code>render @collection</code> and the <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2012/03/polymorphic-routes">polymorphic routing</a>. Those are great features because their scope is limited. I know that I can render a collection in a view. I know I can use polymorphic routing in controllers, models and helpers.</p>

<p>This <code>CurrentAttributes</code> is much too magical for my liking because of how it introduces a thread-local global state which hides where the actual work of setting values on <code>Current</code> is done, and because it is <em>implicit</em> about where those values come from.</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;re just set in the controller!&quot;, may be a defense for this. But what if you don&#39;t have a controller? What if you have a background job instead? How about a test? True, in both cases you could use <code>Current</code> to provide the values:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">perform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">post_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="no">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find_by</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">post_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">run_long_running_thing</span>
  <span class="c1"># code to run the job goes here</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, <code>Post#run_long_running_thing</code> can simply access the current user by accessing <code>Current.user</code>. But it is not immediately clear -- if all you&#39;re looking at is the <code>Post#run_long_running_thing</code> method -- where <code>Current.user</code> is being set in the first place. It&#39;s implied that it&#39;s set somewhere else, but to attempt to find where it&#39;s set in this context may be difficult. Doing a find in the project for <code>Current.user =</code> may turn up multiple places (controllers, jobs, etc.) where the variable is set. Which one is the right one <em>for this context</em>?</p>

<p>As for tests, for those you would need to setup <code>Current.user</code> before hand if you had any code relying on that. I&#39;d imagine something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">let</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:user</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="no">FactoryGirl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:user</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">before</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="no">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">"runs the long running thing"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">run_long_running_thing</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Again, it is not explicit when you&#39;re looking at the <code>run_long_running_thing</code> method or its tests where <code>Current.user</code> is being set.</p>

<p>There doesn&#39;t appear to be anywhere in the <code>CurrentAttributes</code> code -- as far as I can tell -- where it would reset the state of this <code>Current</code> object in between each test. Therefore, setting it in one test like what I&#39;ve done above now makes it bleed through &quot;magically&quot; into other tests. That behaviour seems like a horrible thing to have in a codebase. You could very well have situations where you&#39;re <em>expecting</em> <code>Current.user</code> to be <code>nil</code> but instead it&#39;s set to some vaule because some other test set it. Now which of the 500 tests in my application did that? Good luck finding it.</p>

<h3>Convention over configuration, and perhaps explicitness over implicitness?</h3>

<p>Rails is still a good framework. I know DHH&#39;s rebuttal to this will be &quot;don&#39;t use it then&quot; or something along those lines. Similar to his response to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/25115">my reverting of callback suppression</a> a while back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Protecting programmers from themselves is explicitly not in the charter for Rails when it comes to providing features that have a valid use case but could be abused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just can&#39;t reason with the guy at all. We have vastly different opinions on this sort of thing.</p>

<p>I think Rails choosing to go with ultra-implicitness -- like in this <code>Current</code> case -- is a vastly wrong move that will lead to a lot of frustration with Rails codebases that use this feature. I think Rails should, in situations like this, choose to opt for explicitness over implicitness. Rails has enough magic in it and it certainly doesn&#39;t need any more.</p>

<p>This feature is not something that was sought after (it appears like DHH thought it was a good idea one day and just <em>did it</em>), and we have much better ways of doing this. For instance, in the job code above, it would be better to pass it explicitly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">perform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">post_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find_by</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">post_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">run_long_running_thing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="c1"># code to run the job goes here</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, in the test explictness also wins:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">let</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:user</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="no">FactoryGirl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:user</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">"runs the long running thing"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">run_long_running_thing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In both of these cases, it is <em>very</em> clear how <code>user</code> arrives in the <code>run_long_running_thing</code> method: it is passed in as an argument.</p>

<p>Introducing a global state to Rails seems like a terrible idea and while I deeply, deeply wish this change is reverted, that is very likely not going to happen because it&#39;s DHH&#39;s change and it&#39;s his framework. DHH is allowed to be a footgun merchant if he wishes to be. I am just sad to see that, despite evidence that this is a genuinely bad idea, DHH carried on with it. I thought with his years of experience he would know better by now.</p>
