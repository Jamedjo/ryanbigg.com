            <small>22 Jun 2017</small><br>
            <p>This blog post has been <a href="https://techracho.bpsinc.jp/hachi8833/2017_08_01/43810">translated into Japanese</a>, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/hachi8833">@hachi8833</a>!</p>

<p>I was made aware of <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/24a864437e845febe91e3646ca008e8dc7f76b56">this commit</a> recently (thanks to Rebecca Skinner) to Rails which introduces what is effectively a global state to Rails applications.</p>

<p>Rather than writing why global state in-general is a bad thing myself, I will instead link you to this <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148108/why-is-global-state-so-evil">excellent question + answer on the Software Engineering Stack Exchange</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very briefly, it makes program state unpredictable.</p>

<p>To elaborate, imagine you have a couple of objects that both use the same global variable. Assuming you&#39;re not using a source of randomness anywhere within either module, then the output of a particular method can be predicted (and therefore tested) if the state of the system is known before you execute the method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implementation also chooses to use <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/24a864437e845febe91e3646ca008e8dc7f76b56#diff-3c3c0f647bc4702f9453c173a707aa06R90">thread-local variables</a> which <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8291218/15245">this answer over on Stack Overflow</a> explains is not a good choice because:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s harder to test them, as you will have to remember to set the thread-local variables when you&#39;re testing out code that uses it</li>
<li>Classes who use thread locals will need knowledge that these objects are not available for them but inside a thread-local variable and this kind of indirection usually breaks the law of demeter</li>
<li>Not cleaning up thread-locals might be an issue if your framework reuses threads (the thread-local variable would be already initiated and code that relies on ||= calls to initialize variables might fail</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to mention that this also violates the well-established <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">Law of Demeter</a> too. Suddenly, <code>Current</code> is available <em>anywhere</em> in your application. Good code is <em>explicit</em> in how it makes data available to its methods / functions. This <code>CurrentAttributes</code> feature is not good code, nor is it making it <em>explicitly clear</em> how <code>Current.user</code> arrives in the model. It is just there &quot;magically&quot;.</p>

<p>I enjoy and have benefited from Rails magic in the past. Some of my favourite features are <code>render @collection</code> and the <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2012/03/polymorphic-routes">polymorphic routing</a>. Those are great features because their scope is limited. I know that I can render a collection in a view. I know I can use polymorphic routing in controllers, models and helpers.</p>

<p>This <code>CurrentAttributes</code> is much too magical for my liking because of how it introduces a thread-local global state which hides where the actual work of setting values on <code>Current</code> is done, and because it is <em>implicit</em> about where those values come from.</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;re just set in the controller!&quot;, may be a defense for this. But what if you don&#39;t have a controller? What if you have a background job instead? How about a test? True, in both cases you could use <code>Current</code> to provide the values:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">perform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">post_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="no">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find_by</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">post_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">run_long_running_thing</span>
  <span class="c1"># code to run the job goes here</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, <code>Post#run_long_running_thing</code> can simply access the current user by accessing <code>Current.user</code>. But it is not immediately clear -- if all you&#39;re looking at is the <code>Post#run_long_running_thing</code> method -- where <code>Current.user</code> is being set in the first place. It&#39;s implied that it&#39;s set somewhere else, but to attempt to find where it&#39;s set in this context may be difficult. Doing a find in the project for <code>Current.user =</code> may turn up multiple places (controllers, jobs, etc.) where the variable is set. Which one is the right one <em>for this context</em>?</p>

<p>As for tests, for those you would need to setup <code>Current.user</code> before hand if you had any code relying on that. I&#39;d imagine something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">let</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:user</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="no">FactoryGirl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:user</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">before</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="no">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">"runs the long running thing"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">run_long_running_thing</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Again, it is not explicit when you&#39;re looking at the <code>run_long_running_thing</code> method or its tests where <code>Current.user</code> is being set.</p>

<p>There doesn&#39;t appear to be anywhere in the <code>CurrentAttributes</code> code -- as far as I can tell -- where it would reset the state of this <code>Current</code> object in between each test. Therefore, setting it in one test like what I&#39;ve done above now makes it bleed through &quot;magically&quot; into other tests. That behaviour seems like a horrible thing to have in a codebase. You could very well have situations where you&#39;re <em>expecting</em> <code>Current.user</code> to be <code>nil</code> but instead it&#39;s set to some vaule because some other test set it. Now which of the 500 tests in my application did that? Good luck finding it.</p>

<h3>Convention over configuration, and perhaps explicitness over implicitness?</h3>

<p>Rails is still a good framework. I know DHH&#39;s rebuttal to this will be &quot;don&#39;t use it then&quot; or something along those lines. Similar to his response to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/25115">my reverting of callback suppression</a> a while back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Protecting programmers from themselves is explicitly not in the charter for Rails when it comes to providing features that have a valid use case but could be abused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just can&#39;t reason with the guy at all. We have vastly different opinions on this sort of thing.</p>

<p>I think Rails choosing to go with ultra-implicitness -- like in this <code>Current</code> case -- is a vastly wrong move that will lead to a lot of frustration with Rails codebases that use this feature. I think Rails should, in situations like this, choose to opt for explicitness over implicitness. Rails has enough magic in it and it certainly doesn&#39;t need any more.</p>

<p>This feature is not something that was sought after (it appears like DHH thought it was a good idea one day and just <em>did it</em>), and we have much better ways of doing this. For instance, in the job code above, it would be better to pass it explicitly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">perform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">post_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find_by</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">post_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">run_long_running_thing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="c1"># code to run the job goes here</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, in the test explictness also wins:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">let</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:user</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="no">FactoryGirl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:user</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">"runs the long running thing"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">run_long_running_thing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In both of these cases, it is <em>very</em> clear how <code>user</code> arrives in the <code>run_long_running_thing</code> method: it is passed in as an argument.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s finish by taking a look at the code from the pull request and look at how it can be written more explicitly.</p>

  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">SetCurrentRequestDetails</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Including the <code>Authentication</code> module into <code>ApplicationController</code> to add a single method seems like a bit of premature extraction. Let&#39;s ignore that for now.</p>

<p>This implementation with its <code>before_action</code> to <code>set_current_authenticated_user</code> will mean that <code>Current.user</code> is set on all requests, even those which don&#39;t refer to the <code>current_user</code> at all.</p>

<p>A better implementation would be a <code>current_user</code> method which evaluates its <code>find</code> when it is called. You&#39;ll see this pattern in a lot of Rails applications.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">current_user</span>
  <span class="vi">@current_user</span> <span class="o">||=</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cookies</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">signed</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:user_id</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In fact, this is similar to <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/lib/devise/controllers/helpers.rb#L123-L125">how Devise presents its <code>current_user</code> method</a>. It uses <code>warden</code> instead of <code>cookies.signed</code>, but it&#39;s implementation is similar enough:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">current_</span><span class="c1">#{mapping}</span>
  <span class="vi">@current_</span><span class="c1">#{mapping} ||= warden.authenticate(scope: :#{mapping})</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Ok, so now we&#39;ve got a <code>current_user</code> method which is available in the <em>controllers</em> but what if we want to use it in the view? For instance, if we want to say <code>Hello, #{current_user.name}</code> in a layout? Easy enough: make it a helper method.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">current_user</span>
  <span class="vi">@current_user</span> <span class="o">||=</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cookies</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">signed</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:user_id</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">helper_method</span> <span class="ss">:current_user</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Great, so now it&#39;s available in controllers, helpers and views. All without making it available <em>everywhere</em> in the current thread.</p>

<p>Now I would like to focus on the second half of DHH&#39;s code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MessagesController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
    <span class="no">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">account</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">messages</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">message_params</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Message</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span class="n">belongs_to</span> <span class="ss">:creator</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">default: </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="no">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">user</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="n">after_create</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="no">Event</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">record: </span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Event</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span class="n">before_create</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">request_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">request_id</span>
    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">user_agent</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">user_agent</span>
    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">ip_address</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">ip_address</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, DHH is <em>implicitly</em> linking the message&#39;s creator to the <code>Current.user</code> by using the <code>default</code> option on <code>belongs_to</code>. I believe that this violates the MVC layer abstraction. The <code>Current.user</code> is just &quot;magically&quot; available in the model, with absolutely no context of how it got there in the first place.</p>

<p>A common pattern in Rails applications is not to do this, but instead to explicitly set the <code>creator</code> at the point of creation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
  <span class="vi">@message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">current_account</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">messages</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">message_params</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="vi">@message</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">creator</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">current_user</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let&#39;s assume <code>current_account</code> is a similar abstraction to the <code>current_user</code> one. It&#39;s clear here that in the controller that <em>this</em> is where the <code>creator</code> is assigned. With DHH&#39;s code, it is not immediately clear from the controller code itself that <code>creator</code> is assigned at all.</p>

<p>Not only that, but this also lends itself to being abstracted into a &quot;service object&quot; which is responsible for creating a message. Let&#39;s say that you want to log an <code>Event</code> whenever a <code>Message</code> is created. Oh, I see DHH&#39;s code does that already with an <code>after_create</code> callback. Well then.</p>

<p>In the case of DHH&#39;s code, the <code>after_create</code> callback will happen whenever a <code>Message</code> is created anywhere in your application. This might be suitable in a controller, but what if you want to test some database logic, or something else which requires a persisted message, and you don&#39;t care about an event being there at the same time? What if when you created an event you had extra logic on it which caused <em>another</em> record to be created too?</p>

<p>Having such a callback irrevocably ties together messages and events <em>implicitly</em>.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, it would be better to abstract this into a &quot;service object&quot;.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CreateMessageWithCreator</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">current_user</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">current_account</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">messages</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">message_params</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">message</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">creator</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">current_user</span>
    <span class="n">message</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">save</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can then call this code in your controller like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="no">CreateMessageWithCreator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">message_params</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">current_user</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="no">Event</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">record: </span><span class="n">record</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">flash</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:notice</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Message sent!"</span>
    <span class="n">redirect_to</span> <span class="ss">:index</span>
  <span class="k">else</span>
    <span class="n">flash</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:alert</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Message failed to send."</span>
    <span class="n">render</span> <span class="ss">:new</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This way, then you would know that in <em>this particular case</em> you&#39;re <em>definitely</em> creating a message with a linked creator and it frees you up to create messages without creators or events, if the need did arise.</p>

<p>I think having these dependencies clearly highlighted in the code rather than magically abstracted away is a much, much better solution.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Introducing a global state to Rails seems like a terrible idea and while I deeply, deeply wish this change is reverted, that is very likely not going to happen because it&#39;s DHH&#39;s change and it&#39;s his framework. DHH is allowed to be a footgun merchant if he wishes to be. I am just sad to see that, despite evidence that this is a genuinely bad idea, DHH carried on with it. I thought with his years of experience he would know better by now.</p>
