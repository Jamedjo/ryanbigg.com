        <p>Hi there, my parents and friends call me Ryan Bigg, but you may know me as "Radar". Either is fine.</p>
        <p>I'm a technical writer for Ruby / Rails based in Australia. I'm currently writing a book with <a href="http://yehudakatz.com">Yehuda Katz</a> called <a href="http://manning.com/katz">Rails 3 in Action</a>.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>My name’s Ryan Bigg and I enjoy writing more than most “normal” people would deem normal. On a good day, I can write about 10,000 words. On a bad day, probably 1,500. To see how productive I am I’ve got a <a href="http://whatpulse.org/stats/users/289642/">WhatPulse</a> account which gives me an average keys-per-second which then I can use to gauge how productive I’ve been during writing. Over 10 months I’ve typed 0.5 keys per second on average. That’s a key every 2 seconds. I’ve not been known to sleep-type and occasionally I do step away from the computer, so I consider this impressive.</p>

    <p>I’ve been doing Ruby and Rails for about the past 4 years and I consider myself an expert at it. I don’t profess to know everything, I just know a lot and I’ve got a fair bit of experience at developing Rails applications.</p>

    <p>I write mostly about Ruby and Ruby on Rails, <a href="http://manning.com/katz">I’m even writing a book on it!</a>. Other times I write about the community in general in such posts as <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/want-it-give/">Want it? Give</a>, <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/you-suck/">You suck.</a> and <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/advanced-rails-documentation/">Advanced Rails Documentation</a>. Whilst the tone of some of the posts on this blog may seem angry, I am just extremely passionate about the community and don’t want it to die. If it dies, then I’m basically out of a job. Do not want.</p>

    <p>I’ve done work on the official Rails guides, by writing such interesting guides as the first copy of the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html">Active Record Querying Guide</a> as well as beginning work on <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html">Rails Internals: The Rails 3 Initialization Process</a> and eventually I’ll get around to completing it.</p>

    <p>I’m also trying to float the idea of <a href="https://github.com/radar/guides">Ruby Ecosystem Guides</a>, and perhaps one day receiving donations to work on them for a living. Currently there’s only the Gem Development Guide (using Bundler, Thor, RSpec and Cucumber), but later on I plan on having a guide on how to develop an engine using Rails 3.1.</p>

    <p>Besides writing Gigantic Walls of Text, I also write code. Some of my favourite projects to work on are <a href="http://github.com/radar/rboard">rboard</a> (a forum system built in Rails), <a href="http://github.com/radar/lookup">lookup</a> (a gem that allows you to look up Ruby and Rails methods in the API from your terminal and <a href="http://github.com/radar/summer">summer</a>, a tiny IRC bot framework (with inspiration from <a href="http://github.com/RISCFuture/autumn">autumn</a>.</p>

    <p>I also work as a Ruby on Rails consultant / teacher. My last job was teaching a small team of PHP developers at <a href="http://getup.org.au">GetUp</a> Ruby on Rails and the best practices (such as BDD and Agile) associated with it. My current job, well, I can’t share much information on it at this stage. Let it be known that I’m very excited about it and I hope that I can help a lot of people learn Ruby and Rails during my tenure there.</p>

    <p>I’m really passionate about building a better community for Ruby and for Rails, and I’ve been known to lurk on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> and answer questions there, as well as previously on the #rubyonrails IRC channel. I attend the RoRoSyd meetups in Sydney, some ActionHacks in Brisbane when I’m about, and all the Australian Railscamps. If you need help with anything Ruby or Rails related, ask me and I can probably help you or get you contact with someone who can.</p>
