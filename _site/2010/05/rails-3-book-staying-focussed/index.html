        <p>Sometimes I have difficulty focussing on tasks and getting things done. I think that this is part of being human. There are some times where I will concentrate on a task so fiercely that I will ignore other things, such as that bad smell coming from the laundry basket in the back corner of my room. Then there are the times where I&#8217;m as apathetic to the task as a teenager to homework. I&#8217;ve been asked by a couple of people how I stay so focussed.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s my secret?</p>

<p>I break everything down into tiny chunks so my tiny brain can understand that, in order for there to be &#8220;happy happy joy joy fun time&#8221; this one little task needs to be done. In the process of writing, I&#8217;ve broken the book down into individual stories, just as a real app would be broken down. Each chapter can (and so far, all of them do) contain many stories. So far the average is 4, but with only two &#8220;storied&#8221; chapters written, this is an unfair average. The purpose for breaking it down into stories is two fold: <ol>
  <li>As mentioned before, it demonstrates to the reader how a real application would be developed using BDD. Story by story.</li>
  <li>It "forces" the user to concentrate on just getting one "puzzle piece" done at a time</li>
</ol></p>

<p>There&#8217;s also the top-secret 3rd &#8220;fold&#8221;: It helps me focus when I&#8217;m writing. If I know that there&#8217;s writing to be done (and boy (and girl), there&#8217;s writing to be done!) and I&#8217;m going &#8221;<em>groan</em> more writing!&#8221; I have the willpower to convince myself that if I can write a well-done story tonight it is one more story closer to completion than if I had not. That is enough to convince me that I should probably do some writing. I don&#8217;t have to write the WHOLE chapter in this one sitting. Just this one story. Then I can take a break and give it a skim-through to see if there&#8217;s any glaring omissions and fix them. Then I may even be eager enough after that to take <strong>another</strong> break, perhaps to go to the toilet or grab some food or do that washing that&#8217;s creating that God-awful smell. Anything that let&#8217;s me <strong>just think</strong> about what I&#8217;m doing for a moment, that&#8217;s a good thing. That&#8217;s one less distraction that I&#8217;m going to have when I enter the zone. I&#8217;m not going to think &#8220;I should eat&#8221;, because I already have. Deal with the distractions, then get on with it.</p>

<p>With this &#8220;technique&#8221; applied three weekends ago (a long weekend in Aussie-land) I managed to write nearly 16,000 words. Two weekends ago was my brother&#8217;s birthday, which was fantastic to see him and the rest of the family again. Nothing got done that weekend besides awesome catch up. Then this weekend, I wrote <strong>another</strong> 14,000 words. Between these periods I&#8217;ve been doing some self-editing and editing based on the suggestion of Others Who Cannot Be Named. This has left the total word count at 29,101 as of tonight.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night is the Ruby on Rails Sydney meetup which I&#8217;ll be at so there&#8217;ll be no writing done then, but it&#8217;s <strong>extremely</strong> likely that I&#8217;ll be at the magical 30,000 word mark come headdown (the time when my head hits my pillow) on Wednesday. And then beyond that. Eventually though, there will come a time where I will get to release this to you guys. That&#8217;s when I feel I won&#8217;t be writing as much, just fixing up what&#8217;s already been written. We&#8217;ll see. Perhaps I&#8217;ll feel ultra-motivated and get to that mystical target I&#8217;ve set myself of 20,000 words in a weekend. It&#8217;s a nice sounding number.</p>

<p>So in order to be ultra-focussed I deal with all possible distractions before starting tasks. I&#8217;m finding this is an effective way of being able to stay focussed for long periods of time, and I&#8217;m curious if this works for you too. I know other people use techniques like timeboxing and Pomodoro.</p>

<p>What works for you?</p>
