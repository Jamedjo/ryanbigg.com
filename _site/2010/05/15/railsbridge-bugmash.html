    <p>About a month ago I posted that <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/want-it-give/'>not enough people are helping with Rails</a>. If you&#8217;re keen to get into it, come jump on irc.freenode.net #railsbridge where the May Bugmash is underway. I&#8217;ll be around for the next couple of hours until I head to bed and all of tomorrow helping people out with issues. Come jump in!</p>
