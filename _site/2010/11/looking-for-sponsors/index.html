        <p>Back in September I wrote a post called <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/advanced-rails-documentation/'>"Advanced Rails Documentation"</a>, which talked about there being a dearth of advanced Ruby on Rails documentation about the place.</p>

<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve been talking with <strong>a lot</strong> of people in the Ruby world and that&#8217;s changed my opinion of what&#8217;s truly needed. It&#8217;s not so much the <em>advanced</em> documentation that&#8217;s needed, but more on the intermediate parts of Rails such as using application templates / builders, or even an Engines guide for when 3.1 drops. Piotr Sarnacki has been doing some seriously awesome work on those.</p>

<p>Another example, Railscamp was this weekend just gone. It was <strong> bloody great</strong>. During my time spent coding at it, I worked on investigating and documenting the <code>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper</code> class, in particular, most of the options for the methods such as <code>namespace</code> and <code>resources</code>. If you see anything wrong with the documentation of these methods, I&#8217;m probably your man to ask.</p>

<p>This is the kind of work that I&#8217;d be doing if I received sponsorship prior to January: working on guides and general documentation for Rails and its ecosystem. If you want examples of my work, you need not look any further than the blogs I&#8217;ve written here, as well as <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a>, which is more a beginner-focussed text.</p>

<p>There was a <a href='http://pledgie.com/campaigns/34'>drive just like this back in 2006</a> and that was a resounding success. But back then, Rails was at 1.1.6! Rails has come quite a long way since then, and I think it&#8217;s time that we had some quality, community-sponsored documentation going on. I want to help the community, and I think this is the best way I can be of most use.</p>

<p>The intention of this post is to purely gauge the interest in a project like this. I&#8217;ll write another post during December with a link to a Pledgie (or similar). I&#8217;m more than happy to do it, but a man&#8217;s gotta eat. So my final question is: <strong>would you donate to a project like this, and how much (or what) would you donate?</strong></p>
