        <small>28 Nov 2010</small><br>
        <p>Earlier today I put out <a href='http://twitter.com/ryanbigg/status/8747010869956608'>a tweet</a> which asked:</p>
<blockquote>
site.com/account (Github) or account.site.com (Basecamp) style for per-account URLs?
</blockquote>
<p>There were great arguments from both sides in the debate. Tweets like <a href='http://twitter.com/Sutto/status/8799294744170496'>Darcy Laycock's</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/jms_/status/8770149087707137'>James Ottaway's</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve decided to make it paths for two reasons.</p>
<h3>Easier to test</h3>
<p>Quite simply, paths (http://ticketee.com/account) are much easier to test by booting up <code>rails server</code> than subdomains are. They require no additional configuration by that means and they&#8217;re guaranteed to work on all systems.</p>

<p>Subdomains on the other hand would require use of another tool such as <a href='http://github.com/bjeanes/ghost'>Ghost</a> which would work on Ubuntu and Mac OS X, but not Windows. There is no One True Solution for everybody when it comes to subdomains. Since Rails 3 in Action is intentionally written without discrimination between operating systems, I would prefer this chapter to be no exception to that rule.</p>
<h3>Account sharing</h3>
<p>In the application I am going to be sharing users across accounts. A user that is created on one account, can be gifted access to an alternative account. This would result in an &#8220;open&#8221; system, and I think a path URL would be better for this than a subdomain URL.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your suggestions and the interesting discussions tonight. You&#8217;ve been amazing.</p>
