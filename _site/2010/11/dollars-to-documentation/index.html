        <p>Last week I wrote a post called <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/11/looking-for-sponsors/'>"Looking for Sponsors"</a> where I asked if anyone would be interested in donating to a project where I worked full-time on doing documentation for Rails.</p>

<p>After receiving a great response from it, I&#8217;m <a href='http://pledgie.com/campaigns/14034'>now officially taking donations</a> and <a href='http://docrails.uservoice.com/forums/88055-general'>suggestions on what to document</a>. After all, I want this to be a community-driven event.</p>

<p>I would like to start Monday.</p>

<p>As I say on the Pledgie, I&#8217;ve got some ideas already like finishing the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html'>Initialization Internals Guide</a>, but really I&#8217;m leaving this in the hands of the very capable community.</p>

<p>So how about it? <a href='http://pledgie.com/campaigns/14034'>Give me a couple of dollars</a>, and I&#8217;ll give you some great documentation. Deal?</p>
