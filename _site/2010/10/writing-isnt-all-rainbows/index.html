        <p>There, I said it and I&#8217;ll say it again.</p>

<p>Writing isn&#8217;t all rainbows.</p>

<p>What do I mean by this? Put simply: it&#8217;s not an enjoyable process all of the time. It has its moments, both good and bad. Right now you may be able to tell I&#8217;m having a bad one. I should be writing Rails 3 in Action, but instead I&#8217;m writing this post.</p>

<p>As a famous author once said: &#8220;Writing is like taking a shit. Don&#8217;t if you don&#8217;t <strong>have</strong> to.&#8221;. So I&#8217;m not writing tonight. I am simply not in the mood for it, and to be perfectly honest I am feeling a lot burned out tonight. I am human too.</p>

<p>Writing Rails 3 in Action is difficult. I have to stay on top of the gem changes (such as rspec and rails, which should now be stable) and know what is the &#8220;accepted best practice&#8221; of how to do something. I then have to explain that in exceptional detail so that people get it on their first read and know what I&#8217;m thinking at this point. If a reader gets lost, then I have failed.</p>

<p>I do most of my writing on the weekends, since I am working full time at GetUp. Chapter 8 took me almost a month to complete because it was a very complex chapter that had a lot going on all at once. I eventually re-wrote it and people have been saying it&#8217;s much better. Relief. Chapter 10 took me a little over a week. Chapter 11 should be completed this weekend (its third weekend).</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of writing a book ask yourself one question: What makes yours unique? I&#8217;m trying to make Rails 3 in Action unique by using Cucumber, RSpec, Rails and all the other gems we use to build a full-featured application throughout the entire book. I hope this is unique enough for the readers.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not writing this for the money. Being honest, the advances I&#8217;ve been receiving wouldn&#8217;t even fund my rent for the time it took to write the part I&#8217;m being paid for, let alone all the other fun things you have to pay for in life. There is no way I can live on just the money from the book advances, so I work. Working what is basically super-full-time takes its toll on a person after a while, and I get a little down.</p>

<p>However, when you work at a job where there&#8217;s interesting challenges to solve and good people to work with, then that isn&#8217;t as much of a drag as some would think. GetUp&#8217;s like that, and I&#8217;m thankful for that. I can go home at the end of the day feeling &#8220;accomplished&#8221; and thinking &#8220;what can I accomplish on the book tonight?&#8221;. Those kinds of nights I&#8217;ll bash out a section or two. Tonight is not one of those nights, for reasons I won&#8217;t go into right now.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not writing the book for the money. I&#8217;m not writing it for the fame (got enough, thanks). I&#8217;m writing it because when a person tweets about it or posts to the forum and uses phrases like &#8220;awesome!&#8221; and &#8220;thanks for this, I really love what you&#8217;ve done!&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the &#8220;rainbows&#8221; I live for. That&#8217;s what I write for.</p>

<p>Thanks for your support so far. It makes nights like this all that more tolerable.</p>
