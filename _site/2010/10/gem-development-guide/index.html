        <p>From <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/advanced-rails-documentation/'>my request yesterday</a> asking people what Rails documentation would be valuable, a large group of respondents said they&#8217;d like to see a guide on how to develop a gem. As I figured this would only take me two days to write and would be a good way to promote <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>a certain book</a>, I&#8217;ve begun writing one which I should have finished by tonight with only generators and releasing to cover.</p>

<p>You <a href='http://github.com/radar/guides/blob/master/gem-development.md'>can see it here</a>.</p>

<p>This is the kind of guide I was talking about in yesterday&#8217;s post. They don&#8217;t have to be short and they don&#8217;t have to be long, they just have to be <em>informative</em>. Is this what people would like to see more of? Are the topics I put forward yesterday worthwhile covering or is there something more interesting to the Greater Audience?</p>
