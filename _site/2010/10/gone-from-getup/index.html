        <a href="/2010/10/gone-from-getup"><header>Gone from GetUp</header></a>
        <p>Yesterday was my last day at GetUp. I&#8217;m moving on to bigger and better things now.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been <a href='http://twitter.com/ryanbigg'>following me on Twitter</a> you would have been able to work out by the hints that I&#8217;ve been dropping all week that this was the case. If you didn&#8217;t work it out from the hints then <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/ryanbigg/status/29062245881'>one of last night's messages</a> should have spelled it out clearly enough.</p>

<p>During my time there, I was training up the ex-PHP developers in the ways of Ruby on Rails whilst developing the new version of GetUp&#8217;s website. This is definitely the kind of work that I want to do for as long as I&#8217;m able, it&#8217;s been a blast.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why I&#8217;m leaving the organisation and some of them cannot be made public. What can be made public is that last Thursday changed everything.</p>

<p>I received news early that morning that a very good UK friend of mine, (Angus / Fares Yusuf) Donaldson, had passed away 6 days prior. We had met online a couple of years back, hanging out in #rubyonrails, #offrails and more recently #railsbridge together. It was until March this year when I was on my way to Scotland that we met in person, staying in Heathrow Airport for 7 hours during an epic layover between flights. I kept telling Angus that my flight was at 2:30pm and he kept saying it was fine. By the time Angus brought me to the correct terminal, the flight had already gone through final boarding and I hadn&#8217;t even checked in yet! Angus thought that the <em>check-in</em> time was the one I was saying, NOT the flight departure time. Whilst I was mildly panicking, he sweet-talked an airhostess and got me on the next available flight. I&#8217;ll miss him quite a lot. It made me feel mortal. If the indestructible Angus could die, then I could too.</p>

<p>Later on that morning the other friend I caught up with in the UK, Sam Elliott, sent me a DM about a job that I may be interested in. I looked into it and contacted the people offering it, but then had to leave for work. Was still in a shocked/dazed state when I arrived, I don&#8217;t remember much. At about 10am I had a chat to the company but I wasn&#8217;t able to offer my help because I wasn&#8217;t sure if my contract was going to end the following week or not.</p>

<p>This was one of the things about GetUp and my contract. I never received a paper copy until about 6 months in. During the whole time I was there, my contract was extended by about a month per time, going from end of May to end of June, to end of July, to end of October. These discussions happened usually less than 1 week before the contract expired. Obviously there was still work to do, but I had no hint if the contract was going to still be extended or not. I would have preferred greater notice.</p>

<p>On Thursday night I got some bad news: they were going to be letting two of my team go, James and Charles. I read it as they were &#8220;thinking&#8221; of doing it, but the following Monday found out it was a definite. On Monday afternoon, each of the Online team had one-on-ones with Daryl and Simon with Charles and then James going first. I asked James what they asked him and he showed me a letter with &#8220;Redundancy&#8221; as the header. To be perfectly honest, I was furious at this stage. They were letting the two full-time people on the team who were getting decent at Rails go. I calmed down, sat through my one-on-one without leaping the desk and smashing Simon&#8217;s stupid face into a bloody pulp, went home, and cried.</p>

<p>I talked with a lot of people that night. That was the theme over the next few days as well, just pure talking. Voice chats, text messages, Skype chats&#8230; it was just so much talking. The company I spoke to on Thursday asked me again on Tuesday morning if I&#8217;d still be interested and I basically said &#8220;yes, I&#8217;m very much interested and leaning that way now, but I have to talk to my boss&#8221;. So on Tuesday morning I spoke with Daryl who sympathised with my anger, but wished that I could stay on 6 more weeks. I said that I would have to speak with the other company again.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning, that&#8217;s what happened. They said they needed somebody right away and if they couldn&#8217;t get me, then they&#8217;d have to move on. If I didn&#8217;t leave GetUp, I could have potentially missed out on this fabulous opportunity. I told Daryl the bad news Wednesday morning and he said he was disappointed but agreed that I had to do what was best for me. At the end of the week, I would be leaving GetUp and moving on.</p>

<p>The other company was really happy when I told them late Wednesday morning, and so was I. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve wanted to do for quite a long time and I really think it&#8217;ll benefit the community in a great way. Sorry for being so cryptic about the details, just there&#8217;s very little that I&#8217;m able to share right now.</p>

<p>Thursday and Friday was handover with Alex (contractor) and Francois (full-timer). I wish them the best of luck in developing and delivering v3. On Friday at the team meeting I got given a great well wishes card from the team as well as an awesome satchel bag for my laptop that doesn&#8217;t look as dodgy as a backpack.</p>

<p>On Sunday, my contract expires. After that, I&#8217;m going to be spending two weeks in Brisbane, one of them working for a company up there doing a Rails 3 upgrade work and some pairing with their team and then the following week I begin my contract at this new job. It&#8217;s a remote contract so I&#8217;ll probably just be desk-hopping around the place doing the work. I&#8217;d like to not stay in the house the whole time. The weekend after that is Railscamp, which I&#8217;m really looking forward to.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still going to be writing Rails 3 in Action during this new contract. We&#8217;re hoping to have a new release out Real Soon Now(tm), as soon as I get some time to speak with Yehuda about the latest major review comments. It should contain chapters 1-10 with 11 coming Real Soon After(tm).</p>

<p>The future&#8217;s looking good. See you there.</p>
