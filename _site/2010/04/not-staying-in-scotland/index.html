        <p>So <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/03/staying-in-scotland/'>I posted earlier</a> that I got offered a job in Scotland and was staying for a couple of weeks. (Un?)fortunately this is not the case. As of this writing I&#8217;m sitting very close to Changi Airport&#8217;s C23 in the &#8220;Laptop Access&#8221; area they have here getting my internet fix after a 12-and-a-half hour flight. Sitting in a middle seat. Scotland is a fantastic country and one day I may go back to visit it but for now my home is Sydney, closely followed by Brisbane. If something comes up that is irresistible then perhaps I will move elsewhere, but there are still plenty of opportunities in Australia for me and moving is such a ginormous pain in the ass. If I did move out of the country it&#8217;s more than likely I would have to sell everything I own and start afresh, a prospect I do not look forward to. I simply have too much crap, and I&#8217;m only 22.</p>

<p>So in summary: Staying in Sydney, not Scotland. Catch up with you all when I get the chance :)</p>
