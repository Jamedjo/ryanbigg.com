    <p>So I posted earlier that I&#8217;m writing a book on Rails 3 and I asked for suggestions. Thank you greatly to those who sent them in. Now I&#8217;m looking to put the final touches on the book and because I was slightly inebriated when I got home I decided to record something in Photo Booth rather than writing it down.</p>
<a href='http://vimeo.com/11354142'>So here it is</a>
<p>Hopefully with your feedback by the end of next week I should have a good enough table of contents to start writing this epic.</p>

<p>Thanks for being with me so far!</p>
