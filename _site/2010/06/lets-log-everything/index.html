        <p>The Australian Government <a href='http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/technology/blogs/the-geek/internet-freedom-in-2010-looks-like-1984/20100618-ykr9.html?rand=1276822049429'>has put forward a scheme which they wish to log the activity of every user of the internet</a>. What. The. Fuck?</p>

<p>Must the government fear its citizens so much that it has to monitor their every movement? Lucky we have a lot of spare land to put the datacenters where to keep this new data they&#8217;ll be storing. This means data such as sixteen-year-old girls &#8220;liking&#8221; a picture on Facebook and writing comments like &#8220;omg hayley wat r u doing dere?&#8221;. Seriously, Australia? Fuck.</p>

<p>Again, it&#8217;s also a load of bullshit. Like the internet filter. People who want to keep their communications secret (VPN / SSL anyone?), will do it. The government <em>must</em> find an alternative solution that doesn&#8217;t involve tracking miniscule internet movements of the majority to capture such an infinitesimally small minority. One person&#8217;s a terrorist and suddenly we&#8217;re all suspected of it until proven innocent.</p>

<p>This is not the &#8220;democracy&#8221; I&#8217;ve grown up knowing. It&#8217;s, in the words of Muse, &#8220;demonocracy&#8221;.</p>

<p>It makes me sad that we have a bunch of old fogeys in their ivory towers scheming against the majority without asking it for their opinion. I thought that&#8217;s what democracy was about. I wish they&#8217;d climb to the highest level of their tower and defenestrate their pathetic ideas, followed shortly by theirselves.</p>

<p>You cannot protect everyone from everything all the time. Stop trying.</p>
