    <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action!</a>
<p>Yes, I am writing the Rails 3 in Action book that was originally called &#8220;Merb in Action&#8221; before the Merb+Rails merger. I was approached to join the team to be a co-author with Yehuda Katz at the beginning of April and the process with him &amp; Manning has so far been wonderful! I&#8217;ve been writing the book from scratch since the end of April and so far I have five-and-a-half chapters written with the sixth one (Authentication &amp; Authorization) probably finishing up this weekend.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re aiming to get the book done published by December 2010 in both paperback, PDF and (probably) eBook-reader formats too.</p>
