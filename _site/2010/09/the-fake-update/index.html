        <p>Here&#8217;s a fake update I emailed to my mum earlier today:</p>

<p>Last couple of days have been great :)</p>

<p>Caught up with some strangers who I met online, they lured me into a non-descript white van and blindfolded me and we are somewhere warm underground. The candy was delicious and they say they have more.</p>

<p>But first I have to go and run some &#8220;errands&#8221; for them around San Francisco which they say involves something called &#8220;weed&#8221; (I recommended they go down to the hardware store and get some spray, works well. They laughed.) and some other thing about &#8220;popping caps&#8221; into peoples asses. I&#8217;m no proctologist but they said they would give me training and the tools to do it. Not looking forward to that part but apparently that&#8217;s business.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s this one guy here who people are telling me he&#8217;s &#8220;the man&#8221; (at first I thought they were saying he is &#8220;a man&#8221; and I was all &#8220;duh, have you SEEN his Adams apple?&#8221; and they clarified that they meant he was a &#8220;pig&#8221;. Again I was all &#8220;duh, have you seen him eat?&#8221; and they just rolled their eyes and walked away) I am not sure why he is the man, I was just told never to say it to his face.</p>

<p>Anyway, gotta roll out now. Love you heaps and will send back some presents for you when I get some time off.</p>

<p>(and if it isn&#8217;t obvious yet, this is a big joke and shouldn&#8217;t believed by anyone to be real. I&#8217;ll send you a real update later on :)</p>
