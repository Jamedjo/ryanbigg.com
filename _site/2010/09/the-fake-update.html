            <p>Here&#39;s a fake update I emailed to my mum earlier today:</p>

<p>Last couple of days have been great :)</p>

<p>Caught up with some strangers who I met online, they lured me into a non-descript white van and blindfolded me and we are somewhere warm underground. The candy was delicious and they say they have more.</p>

<p>But first I have to go and run some &quot;errands&quot; for them around San Francisco which they say involves something called &quot;weed&quot; (I recommended they go down to the hardware store and get some spray, works well. They laughed.) and some other thing about &quot;popping caps&quot; into peoples asses. I&#39;m no proctologist but they said they would give me training and the tools to do it. Not looking forward to that part but apparently that&#39;s business.</p>

<p>There&#39;s this one guy here who people are telling me he&#39;s &quot;the man&quot; (at first I thought they were saying he is &quot;a man&quot; and I was all &quot;duh, have you SEEN his Adams apple?&quot; and they clarified that they meant he was a &quot;pig&quot;. Again I was all &quot;duh, have you seen him eat?&quot; and they just rolled their eyes and walked away) I am not sure why he is the man, I was just told never to say it to his face.</p>

<p>Anyway, gotta roll out now. Love you heaps and will send back some presents for you when I get some time off.</p>

<p>(and if it isn&#39;t obvious yet, this is a big joke and shouldn&#39;t believed by anyone to be real. I&#39;ll send you a real update later on :)</p>
