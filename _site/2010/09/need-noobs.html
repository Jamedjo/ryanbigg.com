            <small>23 Sep 2010</small><br>
            <p>I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve mentioned this before but I&#39;m writing <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a> and what I haven&#39;t mentioned before is that I need newbies.</p>

<p>Newbies are the lifeblood of the Ruby community and without them we wouldn&#39;t have a solid foundation. A community without a healthy supply of newbies is a community <strong>that is dying</strong>. </p>

<p>Have you hugged your neighbourhood noob today?</p>

<p>The reason I need newbies is because I&#39;ve got all these awesome reviewers, but most of them are <strong>experienced</strong> Rails developers who are probably assuming the same things I am when reading the book. Somethings to us <strong>just make sense</strong>. Newbies don&#39;t have this ability yet, so I need a couple of people who are interested about learning Ruby on Rails to buy my book and give it a nice hard read. I need the newbies to be critical of everything they read. I need them to point out where a wall-o&#39;-text would be better described in picture form and maybe even a quick sketch if they&#39;re artistically inclined.</p>

<p>I am really appreciative of the current mob I have reviewing the book (and I&#39;m not cheating on you!), I just need more newbies. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to need about 3 more people. These three newbies need to have enough spare time to be able to read the chapters as I&#39;m progressing along with them and provide feedback. Question everything. Does it only make 99% sense? Question it.</p>

<p>In return, I&#39;m told I give good, manly handshakes. I may give you one too. Alternatively if you prefer the whole monetary system, I will pay you the cost of the PDF / book and then maybe <strong>some more</strong>.</p>

<p>Who&#39;s up for this? <strong>If you want to help, buy a copy of <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a>, have a read and post any issues you encounter on the forums! Thanks!</strong></p>
