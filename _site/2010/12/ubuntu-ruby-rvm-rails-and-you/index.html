        <a href="/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you"><header>Ubuntu, Ruby, RVM, Rails, and You</header></a>
        <strong>This beginner's guide will set up with Ruby 1.9.2, RVM and Rails 3.0.3 and is specifically written for Ubuntu 10.10, but will probably work on many other operating systems. YMMV.</strong><h2>Under no circumstance should you install Ruby, Rubygems or any Ruby-related packages from apt-get. This system is out-dated and leads to major headaches. Avoid it for Ruby-related packages. We do Ruby, we know what's best. Trust us.</h2>
<p>Still not convinced? <a href='http://news.ycombinator.org/item?id=2039438'>Read this</a>.</p>

<p>This guide will go through installing the <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com'>RVM (Ruby Version Manager)</a>, then a version of Ruby (1.9.2), then <a href='http://rubyonrails.org'>Rails</a> and finally <a href='http://gembundler.com'>Bundler</a>.</p>

<p>By the end of this guide, you will have these things installed and have some very, very easy ways to manage gem dependencies for your different applications / libraries, as well as having multiple Ruby versions installed and usable all at once.</p>

<p>We assume you have <code>sudo</code> access to your machine, and that you have an understanding of the basic concepts of Ruby, such as &#8220;What is Rubygems?&#8221; and more importantly &#8220;How do I turn this computer-thing on?&#8221;. This knowledge can be garnered by reading the first chapter of <a href='http://manning.com/black2'>any Ruby book</a>.</p>
<h3>Housekeeping</h3>
<p>First of all, we&#8217;re going to run <code>sudo apt-get update</code> so that we have the latest sources on our box so that we don&#8217;t run into any package-related issues, such as not being able to install some packages.</p>

<p>Next, we&#8217;re going to install <a href='http://git-scm.org'>Git (a version control system)</a> and <code>curl</code> which are both required to install and use RVM, and <code>build-essential</code> which is required to compile Ruby versions, amongst other compilable things. To install these three packages we use this command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core curl</code></pre>
<h3>RVM</h3>
<p>RVM is a <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com'>Ruby Version Manager</a> created by Wayne E. Seguin and is extremely helpful for installing and managing many different versions of Ruby all at once. Sometimes you could be working on a project that requires an older (1.8.7) version of Ruby but also need a new version (1.9.2) for one of your newer projects. This is a problem that RVM solves beautifully.</p>

<p>Another situation could be that you want to have different sets of gems on the same version of Ruby but don&#8217;t want to have to do deal with Gem Conflict Hell. RVM has <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/gemsets/basics/'>gemsets</a> for this. <strong>This is a feature you wouldn't have if you used the packaged Ruby</strong>.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re going to use it to install only one version of Ruby, but we can <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com'>consult the documentation</a> if we want to install a different version of Ruby.</p>

<p>With <code>git-core</code> and <code>curl</code> installed we&#8217;ll be able to install RVM with this command:</p>

<pre><code>bash &lt; &lt;( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )</code></pre>

<p>The beautiful part of this is that it installs Ruby to our home directory, providing a sandboxed environment just for us.</p>

<p>Once that&#8217;s done, we&#8217;re going to need to add a line to <code>~/.bashrc</code> file (the file responsible for setting up our bash session) which will load RVM:</p>

<pre><code>echo &#39;[[ -s &quot;$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; source &quot;$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm&quot;&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc </code></pre>

<p>Then we&#8217;ll need to reload the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file which we can do with this small command:</p>

<pre><code>. ~/.bashrc</code></pre>

<p>The next command we run will tell us what other packages we need to install for Ruby to work:</p>

<pre><code>rvm notes
...
# For Ruby (MRI &amp; ree)  you should install the following OS dependencies:
ruby: aptitude install build-essential bison openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev
curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0
libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf</code></pre>

<p>A couple of these packages we&#8217;ve already installed, such as <code>git-core</code> and <code>curl</code>. They won&#8217;t be re-installed again.</p>

<p>These packages will lessen the pain when we&#8217;re working with Ruby. For example, the <code>libssl-dev</code> package will make OpenSSL support in Ruby work, <code>libsqlite3-0</code> and <code>libsqlite3-dev</code> are required for the <code>sqlite3-ruby</code> gem and the <code>libxml2-dev</code> and <code>libxslt-dev</code> packages are required for the <code>nokogiri</code> gem. Let&#8217;s install all these packages now using this command written all on a single line:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential bison openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g
zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf</code></pre>

<p>Now our Ruby lives will be as painless as possible.</p>
<h3>Ruby</h3>
<p>With RVM and these packages we can install Ruby 1.9.2:</p>

<pre><code>rvm install 1.9.2</code></pre>

<p>This command will take a couple of minutes, so grab your $DRINKOFCHOICE and go outside or something. Once it&#8217;s done, we&#8217;ll have Ruby 1.9.2 installed. To begin using it we can use this lovely command:</p>

<pre><code>rvm use 1.9.2</code></pre>

<p>Are we using 1.9.2? You betcha:</p>

<pre><code>ruby -v
ruby 1.9.2p0 (2010-08-18 revision 29036) [x86_64-linux]</code></pre>

<p>Or, even better, would be to make this the <em>default</em> for our user! Oooh, yes!</p>

<pre><code>rvm --default use 1.9.2</code></pre>

<p>Now whenever we open a new bash session for this user we&#8217;ll have Ruby available for us to use! Yay!</p>
<h3>Rails</h3>
<p>Now that RVM and a version of Ruby is installed, we can install Rails. Because RVM is installed to our home directory, we don&#8217;t need to use that nasty <code>sudo</code> to install things; we&#8217;ve got write-access! To install the Rails gem we&#8217;ll run this command:</p>

<pre><code>gem install rails</code></pre>

<p>This will install the <code>rails</code> gem and the other 22 gems that it and its dependencies depend on, including Bundler.</p>
<h3>MySQL</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re planning on using the <code>mysql2</code> gem for your application then you&#8217;ll want to install the <code>libmysqlclient16-dev</code> package before you do that. Without it, you&#8217;ll get an error when the gem tries to compile its native extensions:</p>

<pre><code>Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing mysql2:

<h3>PostgreSQL</h3>
<p>Similar to the <code>mysql2</code> gem&#8217;s error above, you&#8217;ll also get an error with the <code>pg</code> gem if you don&#8217;t have the <code>libpq-dev</code> package installed you&#8217;ll get this error:</p>

<pre><code>    Building native extensions.  This could take a while...

<h3>Fin.</h3>
<p>And that&#8217;s it! Now you&#8217;ve got a Ruby environment you can use to write your (first?) Rails application in with such minimal effort. A good read after this would be the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org'>official guides for Ruby on Rails</a>. Or perhaps the documentation on the <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com'>RVM site</a> which goes into using things such as <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/gemsets/basics/'>gemsets</a> and the exceptionally helpful <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/workflow/rvmrc/#project'>per-project .rvmrc file</a>. A quick way to generate an <code>.rvmrc</code> file is to run a command like this inside the project</p>

<pre><code>rvm use 1.9.2@rails3 --rvmrc</code></pre>

<p>RVM is such a powerful tool and comes in handy for day-to-day Ruby development. Use it, and not the packages from apt to live a life of development luxury.</p>

He&#8217;s got a similar <a href='http://krainboltgreene.github.com/l/3'>write up here for Ubuntu 10.04</a>. Some of the instructions in this guide were &#8220;inspired&#8221; by that post.</p>
