        <small>27 Dec 2010</small><br>
        <p>Yesterday I converted this blog from WordPress to Jekyll, thanks to some prompting from <a href='http://twitter.com/lenary'>Sam Elliott</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/rohitarondekar'>Rohit Arondekar</a>. All in all, the process wasn&#39;t actually all that painful. What triggered this whole thing was three factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>My Slicehost server crashed, possibly due to some intense load I was getting from the <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you'>Ubuntu, Ruby, RVM, Rails and You</a> post I wrote (whilst under the influence of delicious cider).</li>
<li>When the server rebooted, I was unable to boot Apache2 back up because <em>somebody</em> (read: me) had fucked with sqlite3 to try to get his IRC bot to work on the server.</li>
<li>Slicehost charged me $38/month for a 512MB box. Linode charges about half that for the same thing. Fuck Slicehost.</li>
</ul>

<p>So off I went on a magical journey to fix these three problems.</p>

<h3>Never work on live systems</h3>

<p>A rule that every developer has to learn the hard way (be it from anywhere to their own system up to a website with a couple of hundred users) is that you <strong>never ever, ever, ever work on live systems because something will go terribly, terribly wrong</strong>. The second rule that every developer learns is <strong>backups, motherfucker, do you have them?</strong>. So when I had 3 years of posts that I didn&#39;t want to lose I obeyed these two rules.</p>

<h3>Wordpress conversion</h3>

<p>First task was to take an SQL backup from the WordPress install that I had and move it over to my own system. Next, I imported this SQL into a local install of MySQL and made sure it was the latest-and-greatest. Sure, enough it was. Rohit had pointed me at the <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations'>Blog migrations wiki page</a> for Jekyll and it had what appeared to be clear instructions for WordPress there.</p>

<p>So I cloned the <a href='http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a> project into my <code>~/Sites/gems</code> folder and ran just the wordpress commands because I have tunnel vision when reading documentation (note: not my real username and password):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">$ export DB=ryanbigg
$ export USER=lolno 
$ export PASS=nopass4u 
$ ruby -r '~/Sites/gems/jekyll/lib/jekyll/migrators/wordpress' -e 'Jekyll::WordPress.process( "#{ENV["DB"]}", "#{ENV["USER"]}", "#{ENV["PASS"]}")'
</code></pre></div>
<p>To my surprise, it worked. I had a whole bunch of <code>_posts</code> files representing the posts in my system. </p>

<h3>Booting Jekyll</h3>

<p>I installed the <code>jekyll</code> gem itself using <code>gem install jekyll</code> and then ran <code>jekyll --server</code> and it threw up a ton of &quot;errors&quot;, which actually turned out to be warnings about my ability to sometimes intersperse invalid HTML / Markdown with valid Markdown (or the other way around). When I went to http://localhost:4000 I got a 403 error. So I checked out other Jekyll blogs like <a href='http://github.com/qrush/litanyagainstfear'>Nick Quaranto&#39;s litanyagainstfear repository</a> to see what I was missing. I instantly came across the <a href='https://github.com/qrush/litanyagainstfear/blob/master/index.html'>index.html</a> file in this repository and &quot;borrowed&quot; it for my own blog, turning it into <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/master/index.html'>what&#39;s now here</a>. I choose to only show the last 25 posts because everything before that is ancient history. The links to them will still work, but I&#39;m just not showing them in the archive list to conserve space.</p>

<h3>Stylin&#39;</h3>

<p>The next thing I needed to do was to create a <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/master/_layouts/default.html'>default.html layout</a> file in the <code>_layouts</code> folder to style this new home page of mine. I created a <code>css</code> folder at the root of the project and put in <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/master/css/style.css'><code>style.css</code></a> and got to work styling it. I wanted something a little more lightweight than the old theme and I think what I came up with was alright. This morning I added a <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/master/css/mobile.css'><code>mobile.css</code></a> which should format the blog just fine for mobile screens. It looks great on my iPhone 4.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>I wanted to keep the comments from the WordPress site and Rohit recommended Disqus as a way to do that. I installed the <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disqus-comment-system/'>WordPress plugin</a> for it and followed the bouncing ball and had my comments exported to Disqus in no time. I needed to add the following to the <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/0c30ab8b5b9721b16fa125d94270d797d4eb556e/_layouts/post.html#L16-30'>post layout</a> to support the Disqus comment system. The <code>wordpress_id</code> field is the &quot;secret sauce&quot; here for how Disqus knows which post links up to what comments. The only caveat I&#39;ve been informed about for Disqus is that the comments won&#39;t be indexed by Google because they&#39;re loaded via a JavaScript request, but I can tolerate that. Any useful information I would put in a post, probably.</p>

<h3>WordPress pages</h3>

<p>To convert over the pages from WordPress that weren&#39;t posts I&#39;ve copied the source of them (such as the <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/about-me.html'>About me</a> page) and put them as static HTML files in the root of the project. When Jekyll compiles the site, these are copied over to the <code>_site</code> directory.</p>

<h3>Deployment</h3>

<p>Currently going via the low-tech method of an SSH + <code>git pull</code> on the server, but hoping to switch to a commit hook in the future.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p>The benefits are many. My posts are now <a href='http://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com'>open source</a> which means that if people find problems with them that can send in pull requests, but that&#39;s just a pipe dream probably. </p>

<p>The main benefit is the speed. On the vanilla WordPress install I had I was lucky to get 2 requests per second for the home page. With Jekyll, I&#39;m getting about 2,300 reqests per second. This is due to the fact all my posts are static assets now. I think I could double this if I <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2009/06/how-to-make-your-rails-application-578-times-faster/'>switched to Nginx</a>, which I plan on doing when I don&#39;t have a use for the PHP version anymore.</p>

<p>I also get to write my posts the way I like to: Markdown + HTML. No crummy little editor window, I can do it all from within TextMate.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really liking Jekyll as lightweight alternative to WordPress and it&#39;s great to finally be off a PHP-based system. I mean, if Ruby is so good <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here'>why would I be using a PHP based system?</a></p>
