            <p>I am your helpdesk.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right. Me. The Ruby programmer who works by day and writes by night and helps you out in between (and sometimes in dreams).</p>

<p>You come to me with your computer troubles and most of the time you leave without them. I usually am quite happy to help you, but I must confess my motivations are entirely selfish. I help you to help me.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve got a problem and you don&#39;t know how to fix it then you approach me (or in the case of my day job, one of the tech team). This is because I&#39;m perceived to &quot;know about computers&quot; even though I specialise in Ruby and web development. Sometimes it&#39;s not even computers. Sometimes your router was connecting to the internet and &quot;now it just doesn&#39;t, I did nothing I swear!&quot;.</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve got a problem. Ok. What&#39;s the end goal? Are you trying to open a file? Connect to the internet? Build a death ray? Good. We&#39;ve got that sorted. Ok, what could possibly be wrong? Is the file corrupt? Are the cables connected properly? Did you forget to turn it on?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll go through the steps I know that should work because I&#39;ve done this before. Why have I done it before? Because I&#39;ve been there. Because I&#39;ve seen someone else do it. Because I just have an uncanny knack for Figuring Shit Out. Somewhere along the line, something isn&#39;t quite right. We&#39;ll work through it and at the end of it I&#39;ll explain what the problem was and you&#39;ll nod your head in agreement and wait patiently for me to finish explaining things and then I&#39;ll go away feeling like I&#39;ve helped somebody.</p>

<p>Later on down the line when I encounter this issue, I&#39;ll know how to fix it. Because I&#39;ve been there before. By helping you, I help me.</p>

<p>So when the little prissy web developers tell stories of being approached by their computer-illiterate co-workers and being asked for help... they tell the story in such a fashion:</p>

<blockquote>But I'm a web developer, not helpdesk! Just because I know *something* about computers doesn't mean I know everything! Why are they coming to me?</blockquote>

<p>Well listen up, softie. They&#39;re coming to you because they respect your opinion. They think you have the brains required to solve this little issue and it shouldn&#39;t be below you to help them out. </p>

<p>Do it. Contribute back to the world in that little fashion by showing them that the USB cable doesn&#39;t go into the network plug (uh huh, I&#39;ve seen it and check for it now) and that it actually goes in this smaller rectangular socket. And don&#39;t do it condescendingly. Take them through the steps they need to know in order to fix it so that they can do it in the future and perhaps show somebody else.</p>

<p>Perhaps you&#39;ll learn something in the process.</p>
