    <p>Today I upgraded the Cucumber gem on my system (still had 0.7.something) only for it to break!</p>

<pre><code>uninitialized constant RSpec (NameError)
/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/cucumber-0.8.3/bin/../lib/cucumber/rb_support/rb_language.rb:51:in `enable_rspec_expectations_if_available&#39;</code></pre>

<p>I saw this error last week on a workmate&#8217;s computer and both times it was fixed by removing the <code>rspec-expectations</code> gem which is a part of the RSpec 2 gem collection. I had these left over from when I was playing around with Rails 3 (now I&#8217;m using RVM). The latest version of Cucumber maintains compatibility between these two versions and does so by trying to require <em>rspec/expecatations</em> which will be available if the <code>rspec-expectations</code> gem is installed. So if you&#8217;re trying to use RSpec 1 and 2 and Cucumber at the same time, you may run into this issue. So far the best solution I&#8217;ve found is uninstalling <code>rspec-expectations</code>.</p>

<p>Just thought I&#8217;d let you know. It&#8217;s bitten us twice and may bite you.</p>
