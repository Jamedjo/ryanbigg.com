        <p>Last night whilst I was sleeping (something I do regularly during the night), the first release of the new Rails 3 in Action book took place! You <s>can</s> <strong>will</strong> go out and <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>grab yourself a copy now</a>. Please?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a fun process writing the book so far. I&#8217;ve got a couple of very dedicated people helping me and it&#8217;s definitely the people who have made the process what it&#8217;s been. Currently I&#8217;m working on Chapter 7 which should be &#8220;finished&#8221; sometime this afternoon and then I&#8217;ll begin on Chapter 8 which I hope to have finished by next weekend.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, words of encouragement, professions of love or otherwise, you can write about them on the <a href='http://www.manning-sandbox.com/forum.jspa?forumID=541'>book's forum</a> and I&#8217;ll reply as soon as I can.</p>

<p>Thanks for supporting me so far!</p>
