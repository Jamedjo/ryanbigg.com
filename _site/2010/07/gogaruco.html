        <p>After going to Scotland in March and attending the very awesome Scottish Ruby Conference I still feel like travelling. For quite a long time I&#39;ve wanted to go to San Francisco and check out the Ruby scene there and I also have a couple of people who I&#39;d love to catch up with in other parts of the country. So I&#39;m going to be doing an &quot;American tour&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking of flying in on the 15th September, staying for 2 weeks and leaving on the 29th or 30th. So far I&#39;ve planned as far as attending GoGaRuCo (probably not speaking, unless they want me to) and perhaps spending a day or two in SF going to bug the EngineYard and GitHub guys.</p>

<p>After that? I&#39;ve got invites to go visit people in Indiana, Ohio and Florida and so that&#39;s what I&#39;ll be doing. No specific dates yet, but there&#39;s definitely a whole slew of people from the Ruby community who I&#39;d love to meet.</p>

<p>Thanks to the people who have already offered accommodation! In my single overseas trip experience so far, this takes a <em>lot</em> of hassle out of doing it!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll see you when I get there!</p>
