    <p>Within 24 hours of announcing <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/01/why-mocra-is-awesome/'>I left Mocra</a>, I received many, many job offers and it astounded me. It astounded me that I was so <strong>wanted</strong> by people from <strong>around the world</strong>.</p>

<p>They came from near and far and I ended up picking <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/rails-oceania/browse_thread/thread/ce9aa2e9a56f0ebe'>a 3 month contract with GetUp</a> in Sydney. I loved what I did at Mocra, but I love what I do at GetUp more. Both Mocra and GetUp are superb and really, really passionate about what they do.</p>

<p>I started on 22nd February and I&#8217;m still working there. What was originally a &#8220;3 month contract&#8221; has now turned into an 8-month contract, with the possibility of being extended even further than that. I&#8217;ve taught the team Ruby on Rails the best way I know how (inspired by Dr. Nic &amp; my experiences at Mocra) and we&#8217;re rockin&#8217;. Still. I get up (no pun intended) in the morning and go &#8220;I <strong>have</strong> to go to work&#8221; not &#8221;<span>groan</span> I <strong>have</strong> to go to work.&#8221; At least, most days.</p>

<p>Then in April, shortly after I return from Scotland, I get contacted by <a href='http://manning.com'>Manning Publications</a> who ask me to be a co-author for no book other than <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a>. That morning I bounced off the walls. Overjoyed is an understatement. Think teen girl at Justin Bieber concert and you&#8217;re getting about a tenth of the way there. I love writing and I love teaching.</p>

<p>So I took that job up too, along with the GetUp job. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve juggled two jobs (since my Coles/PHP freelancing days) but I&#8217;m handling it surprisingly well and I think it&#8217;s mostly in part to the awesome teams I work with for both of them.</p>

<p>But by the end of the year, there&#8217;s a huge chance that I&#8217;ll be done with both of them. I will have taught the GetUp team a lot of what I know about Ruby on Rails (and they&#8217;ll have taught me some too!) and I will have finished and published the book.</p>

<p>So then what? Well, that part&#8217;s up for debate.</p>

<p>On one hand, staying in Australia would be great because I have a lot of friends here and I&#8217;m generally well-known to get work if I need it. But you could apply that to the other hand too.</p>

<p>The other hand, I&#8217;m famous &#8220;online&#8221;. I even have <a href='http://twitpic.com/285uam'>a shirt</a> that says it. I could probably get work anywhere in the world, and I&#8217;ve received a couple of offers from places like the US, Denmark, Scotland and London. But, these are all development-only jobs. I much prefer a decent mix of teaching and developing, or maybe even both at the same time. I feel by teaching new people that they will go out and teach more people. If I&#8217;m developing, I&#8217;m not widening the pool of available developers and not helping the community grow. This is something I really want to do.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m looking for in a job <strong>isn't full-time development</strong>. <u>My ideal "job" is going around the world teaching people about proper Ruby on Rails development and about proper Agile development.</u></p>

<p>I want to be able to teach people. To watch them grow. For them to say &#8216;aha!&#8217; when they finally get a concept. For them to teach me new things. For us to develop something really great.</p>

<p>For now, I am happy working at GetUp. If they want me to stay on longer then I&#8217;m very inclined to say yes. If they don&#8217;t, then it&#8217;s been fantastic.</p>

<p>My contract with GetUp runs out at the end of October. 3 months from now.</p>

<p>If you want me to help your team <a href='mailto:radarlistener@gmail.com'>now's the time to let me know.</a></p>
