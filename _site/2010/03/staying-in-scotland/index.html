        <small>31 Mar 2010</small><br>
        <p>This past week I <strong>a</strong>ttended the Scottish Ruby Conference and for the week <strong>pri</strong>or I was experiencing the joy that is Scot<strong>l</strong>and. I have made a decision to stay on a couple o<strong>f</strong> weeks and I ap<strong>o</strong>l<strong>o</strong>gise for those who I haven&#8217;t yet discussed this with.</p>

<p>Since the conference, I have been discussions with one of the local companies who wish to hire me to teach Ruby after my contract with GetUp has expired. I&#8217;m going to their offices in Edinburgh today for a meeting to discuss this. I think they&#8217;re fantastic people and it would be almost as much joy to work with them as it has been to work with GetUp and I would name them if it wasn&#8217;t for a damn NDA. GetUp&#8217;s going to be exceptionally hard to beat.</p>

<p>I may return to Australia to collect some things and put my affairs in order eventually, but Scotland just feels like the right place to be at the moment. It&#8217;s much closer to a larger number of countries than Australia with greater opportunities in the Ruby &amp; Rails sectors and I love everything here.</p>

<p>Later on today I will contact GetUp and let them know that I&#8217;m still willing to do work for them, albeit remotely, and I hope they will understand.</p>

<p>More on this <strong>l</strong>ater. <strong>S</strong>ee you then!</p>
