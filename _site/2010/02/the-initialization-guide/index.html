        <small>08 Feb 2010</small><br>
        <p>For a couple of weeks now I&#39;ve been writing <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/guides/initialization.html">a guide on how the initialization process in Rails 3 works</a>. As of writing, the guide and its accompanying &quot;notes&quot; totals over 10,000 words. I admit that this is currently nowhere near completion, but I am working on it and I need <strong>your help</strong>. I need people to go over it for me and point out anything that they don&#39;t quite understand or I have stated incorrectly and <a href="http://github.com/radar/how-rails-works/issues">file an issue on the repository for it.</a> Originally I was going to accept pull requests but they aren&#39;t &quot;public knowledge&quot; and I don&#39;t want two or more people submitting pull requests to fix the same chunk of code. With issues, people can see that &quot;oh, there&#39;s already a typo here.&quot; and move on to finding more errors and punching more holes through it.</p>

<p>So yeah, if you guys could <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/guides/initialization.html">read my guide</a> and  <a href="http://github.com/radar/how-rails-works/issues">file any issues you find with it</a>, that&#39;d be swell!</p>
