        <a href="/2010/02/the-initialization-guide"><header>The Initialization Guide</header></a>
        <p>For a couple of weeks now I&#8217;ve been writing <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/guides/initialization.html'>a guide on how the initialization process in Rails 3 works</a>. As of writing, the guide and its accompanying &#8220;notes&#8221; totals over 10,000 words. I admit that this is currently nowhere near completion, but I am working on it and I need <strong>your help</strong>. I need people to go over it for me and point out anything that they don&#8217;t quite understand or I have stated incorrectly and <a href='http://github.com/radar/how-rails-works/issues'>file an issue on the repository for it.</a> Originally I was going to accept pull requests but they aren&#8217;t &#8220;public knowledge&#8221; and I don&#8217;t want two or more people submitting pull requests to fix the same chunk of code. With issues, people can see that &#8220;oh, there&#8217;s already a typo here.&#8221; and move on to finding more errors and punching more holes through it.</p>

<p>So yeah, if you guys could <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/guides/initialization.html'>read my guide</a> and <a href='http://github.com/radar/how-rails-works/issues'>file any issues you find with it</a>, that&#8217;d be swell!</p>
