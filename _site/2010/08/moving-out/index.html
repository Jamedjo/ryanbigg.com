        <p>At the beginning of the week my housemates and I chat and the conversation was basically thus:</p>
<blockquote>
Housemates: "Ryan we love you (as a housemate) and we found this awesome 3 bedroom place in Ultimo, wanna come with us? It's big!"<br />
Me: "OMG YSPLZ" (I work in Surry Hills)
</blockquote>
<p>I went through the week thinking I was doing well with my housemates.</p>

<p>I come back this afternoon from a shopping trip and the conversation goes like this:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Housemates: &quot;Ryan, our cousin is being kicked out because he had an argument with her housemate and we&apos;re thinking of letting her move in here.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Me: &quot;That&apos;s OK, we have the spare bed.&quot;&lt;br .
Housemates: &quot;No... could you leave in 4 weeks time so she could move in? She&apos;s family. Please?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Me: &quot;...&quot; (but in my head there was &lt;a href=&apos;http://hachidori.org/blog/images/fffuuuuuu.png&apos;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
Me: &quot;Ok, I will see what I can do.&quot; (but in my head &lt;a href=&apos;http://www.gymidiots.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/son-i-am-disappoint.gif&apos;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</pre>
<p>So I find myself in quite the fun situation again of having to look for a new place. I&#8217;ve re-opened my ad on easyroomate and hopefully I&#8217;ll get as many bites as I did last time. I&#8217;ve also been applying for some places and I got a pretty alright hit rate from that last time too. We&#8217;ll see how things go this time.</p>

<p>So in 4 weeks time, I&#8217;ll be out of this place and in my new one. I&#8217;ll be sad to leave Marcelo and Larissa, but I suppose I do have to get out and explore some more.</p>

<p>Some may view this as a dickish move, but I don&#8217;t. I understand where they&#8217;re coming from. I hope them all the best and I have no bad feelings towards them.</p>

<p>I just hope I don&#8217;t end up like <a href='http://www.kavistechnology.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/istock_000001389194xsmall.jpg'>this</a>.</p>
