        <small>07 Aug 2010</small><br>
        <p> I wrote a post last weekend saying that my housemates were asking me to move out so that their cousin could move in. Since then, I&#8217;ve looked at about 6 different places throughout the week like:</p>

<ul>
<li>A place in Surry Hills on the 7th floor of an apartment building</li>

<li>Tiny little room in a terrace in Surry Hills</li>

<li>A largeish room in Five Dock, but way way waaay away from public transport</li>

<li>A medium-sized room in Narwee, with a really awesome guy</li>

<li>A tiny room in Summer Hill</li>
</ul>

<p>I got all these contacts through the sites <a href='http://gumtree.com.au'>Gumtree.com.au</a> and <a href='http://easyroommate.com.au'>Easyroommate.com.au</a>, and it&#8217;s a really easy process. Just getting to the places take a while.</p>

<p>I met quite the broad spectrum of people and was keen on moving to Narwee since that was the most affordable and the guy was a linux sysadmin (this is the part where you berate me for not stepping outside my comfort zone, and where I counter-claim that comfort zones exist for reasons you <em>just wouldn&#8217;t understand</em>).</p>

<p>Then as I was going between places today my current housemates text me with a whole slew of pictures showing an awesome 3 bedroom house that we can all move into basically around the corner from where we&#8217;re at right now. First bedroom&#8217;s for them, second for their cousin and third for me, so it all works out well. And with 3 different &#8220;groups&#8221; paying the rent, it&#8217;s going to be way cheaper than any of the other places. So I think I&#8217;ll be sticking with these guys since they&#8217;re only thinking of having it for the short term (until December) anyway. It&#8217;s great that I get to stay with Marcelo and Larissa, I really enjoy their company.</p>

<p>Of course by me now staying with them, I now have to phone up the people who I&#8217;ve &#8220;interviewed&#8221; with over this past week and tell them all &#8220;thanks but no thanks&#8221;. That&#8217;s a &#8220;tomorrow job&#8221;, for certain. Totally buggered tonight.</p>

<p>It&#8217;d be nice having a little bit of certainty for my future, but I should know by this stage (after moving interstate twice in two years) that certainty is only a word, and would never be more than that. Nothing is certain, everything changes, and you just have to deal with it. This is just another one of those things. Next year I may even be in another country. I&#8217;m cool with that. Parents may not be, however.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m here until December at least, and then after that I guess I&#8217;ll go all mercenary and sell my soul / body to the highest bidder / most awesome looking place. Who knows? Nothing is certain. Everything changes.</p>
