        <p>Hi there, my parents and friends call me Ryan Bigg, but you may know me as "Radar". Either is fine.</p>
        <p>I'm a technical writer for Ruby / Rails based in Australia. I have written a Rails book with <a href="http://yehudakatz.com">Yehuda Katz</a> called <a href="http://manning.com/bigg2">Rails 4 in Action</a>, which is available also on <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Rails-3-Action-Ryan-Bigg/dp/1935182277'>Amazon</a>. I wrote <a href='http://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails'>Multitenancy With Rails</a>, and I'm in the process of writing my third book <a href='http://leanpub.com/debuggingruby'>Debugging Ruby</a>.

          I won a <a href='http://rubyheroes.com'>Ruby Hero</a> award in 2011 for my work on documentation for Rails. I keep some guides in my <a href='http://github.com/radar/guides'>guides</a> repository on GitHub. As part of this documentation, I've worked on the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html'>Asset Pipeline</a>, <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html'>Active Record Query Interface</a>, <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html'>Configuring Rails Applications</a>, <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html'>Getting Started with Engines</a> and the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html'>Rails Initialization Internals</a> guides. I've also been known to hang out on <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/users/15245/ryan-bigg'>Stack Overflow</a>.

<h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="entry">
    <h3>
      My name's Ryan Bigg and I am currently gainfully employed at
      <a href='http://spreecommerce.com'>Spree Commerce</a> as the Community Manager there. My job is to make your life with Spree an amazing experience. I triage issues, reply to users' questions on the mailing list and spend the remainder of that time developing features for Spree.<br><br>

      I wrote a book called <a href='http://manning.com/bigg2'>Rails 4 in
      Action</a> with <a href='http://yehudakatz.com'>Yehuda Katz</a> and <a
      href='http://blog.steveklabnik.com/'>Steve Klabnik</a>. You should buy
      this book, as it teaches you how to develop a Rails application the
      right way using BDD and TDD best practices and helps me a little to keep
      the lights on.<br><br>

      I also wrote <a href='http://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails'>Multitenancy with Rails</a> and I'm currently writing <a href='http://leanpub.com/debuggingruby'>Debugging Ruby</a>.<br><br>
    </h3>

    <p>
      I've been doing Ruby and Rails for about the past 8 years and I consider myself an expert at it. Just look at my <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/users/15245/ryan-bigg'>Stack Overflow score</a>. I don't profess to know everything, I just know a lot and I've got a fair bit of experience in developing Rails applications. To be honest: I learned a lot of what I know from spending <em>way too much</em> time in the rubyonrails-talk mailing list, the #rubyonrails IRC channel on Freenode, and Stack Overflow.</p>


      <p>
      I'm passionate about learning new languages and technologies, although the time spent working with Ruby and writing books kind of eats into that. Particularly interested in <a href='http://golang.org'>Go</a> and <a href='http://emberjs.com'>EmberJS</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      I write mostly about Ruby and Ruby on Rails, <a href="http://manning.com/bigg2">I've even written a book on it!</a> Other times I write about the community in general in such posts as <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/you-suck/">You suck.</a>, <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/advanced-rails-documentation/">Advanced Rails Documentation</a> and <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2012/03/please-learn-rails/'>Please learn Rails</a></p>
    
    <p>Super-popular posts of mine include the <a
      href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/'>Ubuntu, Ruby, RVM, Rails, and You</a> and
    its "sequel" <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2011/06/mac-os-x-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/'>Mac OS X, Ruby, RVM, Rails
      and You</a>, as well as <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/02/congratulations'>Congratulations</a>, a post
    based on a true story about how I got into doing Test Driven Development.
    </p>

    <p>I've done <a href='http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/ryan-bigg/commits'>a lot of work on the official Rails guides</a>, enough to be ranked #17 for all time Rails committers at the time of writing. I've done this by writing such interesting guides as the first copy of the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html">Active Record Querying Guide</a> as well as beginning work on <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html">Rails Internals: The Rails 3 Initialization Process</a>, which is quite a massive beast and one day I will complete it. I also helped out with the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html'>Configuring Rails Applications</a> guide, updating it to Rails 3, and played a large part in the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html'>Asset Pipeline Guide</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm also writing other guides that don't fit into the Rails guides over on <a href="https://github.com/radar/guides">my personal guides repository</a>.</p>

    <p>Besides writing Gigantic Walls of Text, I also write code. Some of my favourite projects to work on are <a href="http://github.com/radar/forem">forem</a> (a lightweight forum engine built for Rails 3.1+ applications), <a href="http://github.com/fcoury/octopi">octopi</a> (a gem that interacts with the GitHub API) and <a href="http://github.com/radar/summer">summer</a>, a tiny IRC bot framework (with inspiration from <a href="http://github.com/RISCFuture/autumn">autumn</a>).<p>
    
    <p>It's my full-time job to work on the best Rails e-commerce platform, <a href='https://github.com/spree/spree'>Spree</a>, too.</p>

    <p>
      Over my development life I've worked with many, many teams developing Rails applications.
    </p>

    <p>In 2007, I worked my first full-time Rails job at <a href='http://sealink.com.au'>SeaLink</a> helping them build their new reservations system.</p>

    <p>In 2008, I worked with a small consultancy called NetFox in Adelaide developing various web applications. In this year I also helped coordinate the first <a href='http://railscamps.org'>Railscamp</a> held in Adelaide, Railscamp #4.</p>

    <p>In 2009, I worked at a consultancy called Mocra in Brisbane, again developing web applications for clients. It was here that I really became a zealot of TDD/BDD.</p>

    <p>In 2010, I introduced a small team of PHP developers at <a href="http://getup.org.au">GetUp</a> in Sydney to Ruby on
    Rails and the best practices (such as BDD and Agile) associated with it. All of the developers, aside from
    one, are now doing Ruby on Rails development professionally. The one that's not doing Rails development has chosen to study
    economics, but still has a passion for programming.</p>

    <p>In 2011, I worked as a Ruby on Rails consultant for <a href='http://rubyx.com'>RubyX</a> in Sydney. It was
    my favourite consulting job so far. I performed extensive code reviews of existing applications, training and application development and
    really enjoyed it. </p>

    <p>Between April of 2010 and September of 2011, I was working on the first edition of <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a> during my spare time. I even found additional time to build a review system called Twist when I found Manning's own to be insufficient for my own needs. In Twist, authors and reviews can <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/about-me/twist-chapter-view.png'>view individual chapters</a> and <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/about-me/twist-note-view.png'>start discussions about particular elements</a>.
   
    <p>In November of 2011, I left RubyX after <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2011/11/going-on-a-spree/'>being
      offered a job by Spree Commerce</a> to work full time as the Community Manager and developer of the Spree
    e-commerce platform. <strong>This is now my current job.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Between February and May 2012 I travelled across the US meeting all my programming friends there and attending some conferences, such as <a href='http://spreeconf.com'>SpreeConf</a>, <a href='http://ruby.onales.com'>Ruby on Ales</a> and <a href='http://railsconf.com'>RailsConf</a>. I spoke at SpreeConf and Ruby on Ales, but not RailsConf. During this trip I visited about 12 different cities over an almost 3 month period.</p>

    <p>In 2013, I am still working at Spree. In this year I have written another book called <a href='http://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails'>Multitenancy with Rails</a> and in November I started writing my third book called <a href='http://leanpub.com/debuggingruby'>Debugging Ruby</a></p>

    <p>
      I am not actively looking for any more jobs. If you still really really really feel like contacting me about a job, <strong>include the phrase "Bravo Foxtrot Uniform"</strong> so I know that you've done your research.
   </p>

    <p>I've recently moved to Melbourne (originally from Adelaide, but I've also lived in Brisbane and Sydney). I attend the local user group meetups when I can, and all the Australian Railscamps. I have been known to travel great distances to attend greater conferences. I enjoy giving talks at those conferences.
    </p>

    <p>If you need help with anything Ruby or Rails related, ask me and I can probably help you or get you contact
    with someone who can. Or you could read <a href='http://manning.com/bigg2'>Rails 4 in Action</a>, <a href='http://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails'>Multitenancy with Rails</a> or <a href='http://leanpub.com/debuggingruby'>Debugging Ruby</a> :)</p>
