        <p>Hi there, my parents and friends call me Ryan Bigg, but you may know me as "Radar". Either is fine.</p>
        <p>I'm a technical writer for Ruby / Rails based in Australia. I have written a Rails book with <a href="http://yehudakatz.com">Yehuda Katz</a> called <a href="http://manning.com/katz">Rails 3 in Action</a>, which is available also on <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Rails-3-Action-Ryan-Bigg/dp/1935182277'>Amazon</a>.

            I won a <a href='http://rubyheroes.com'>Ruby Hero</a> award in 2011 for my work on documentation for Rails. I keep some guides in my <a href='http://github.com/radar/guides'>guides</a> repository on GitHub. As part of this documentation, I've worked on the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html'>Asset Pipeline</a>, <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html'>Active Record Query Interface</a>, <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html'>Configuring Rails Applications</a> and the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html'>Rails Initialization Internals</a> guides. I've also been known to hang out on <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/users/15245/ryan-bigg'>Stack Overflow</a>.
          </p>
          <p> Occasionally I find some time to write interesting blog posts such as the ones you see below.</p>
          <p>I also have done quite a lot of <a href="http://github.com/radar">open-source work</a> and I <a href="http://twitter.com/ryanbigg">tweet</a>. Find out more <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/about-me">about me</a>.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="entry">
    <h3>
      My name's Ryan Bigg and I enjoy writing (text + code) more than most "normal" people would deem normal. On a good day, I can write about 10,000 words. On a bad day, probably 1,500. I am currently gainfully employed at <a href='http://rubyx.com'>RubyX</a> doing awesome things with Ruby code. We're amazing at what we do. On the side of my Real Job&trade;, I wrote a book called <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a> which you should buy, as it teaches you how to develop a Rails application the right way.
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      <strong>If you're a recruiter contacting me for a job, please note the previous paragraph, more specifically: the fact that I already have a job. If you still think about contacting me, include the phrase "Bravo Foxtrot Uniform" so that I can verify you've done your research.</strong> If you do not do your research then why should I bother even replying to your email? It's a two-way street, bucko. If I <a href='http://sivers.org/hellyeah'>don't say "HELL YEAH"</a> to your job, then I'm not interested, sorry! That may seem harsh, but I'd rather be upfront with people than lying to them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Alright, that's the boring formalities out of the way.
    </p>

    <p>I've been doing Ruby and Rails for about the past 5 years and I consider myself expert at it. Just look at my <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/users/15245/ryan-bigg'>Stack Overflow score</a>. I don't profess to know everything, I just know a lot and I've got a fair bit of experience in developing Rails applications. To be honest: I learned a lot of what I know from spending <em>way too much</em> time in the #rubyonrails IRC channel on Freenode and Stack Overflow.</p>

    <p>I write mostly about Ruby and Ruby on Rails, <a href="http://manning.com/katz">I've even written a book on it!</a> Other times I write about the community in general in such posts as <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/you-suck/">You suck.</a>, <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/advanced-rails-documentation/">Advanced Rails Documentation</a> and <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2011/03/when-to-cuke/'>When to Cuke</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Super-popular posts of mine include the <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/'>Ubuntu, Ruby, RVM, Rails, and You</a> and its "sequel" <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2011/06/mac-os-x-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/'>Mac OS X, Ruby, RVM, Rails and You</a>.

    <p>I've done <a href='http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/ryan-bigg/commits'>a lot of work on the official Rails guides</a>, enough to be ranked #17 for all time Rails committers at the time of writing. I've done this by writing such interesting guides as the first copy of the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html">Active Record Querying Guide</a> as well as beginning work on <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html">Rails Internals: The Rails 3 Initialization Process</a>, which is quite a massive beast and one day I will complete it. I also helped out with the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html'>Configuring Rails Applications</a> guide, updating it to Rails 3, and played a large part in the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html'>Asset Pipeline Guide</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm also writing other guides that don't fit into the Rails guides over on <a href="https://github.com/radar/guides">my personal guides repository</a>.</p>

    <p>Besides writing Gigantic Walls of Text, I also write code. Some of my favourite projects to work on are <a href="http://github.com/radar/forem">forem</a> (a lightweight forum engine built in Rails), <a href="http://github.com/fcoury/octopi">octopi</a> (a gem that interacts with the GitHub API) and <a href="http://github.com/radar/summer">summer</a>, a tiny IRC bot framework (with inspiration from <a href="http://github.com/RISCFuture/autumn">autumn</a>.</p>

    <p>I also work as a Ruby on Rails consultant for <a href='http://rubyx.com'>RubyX</a> in Sydney. We're awesome. I do code reviews, training and application development there and am really enjoying it. I am not actively looking for any more jobs. I said this before, but it bears repeating.</p>
    
    <p>My last job was teaching a small team of PHP developers at <a href="http://getup.org.au">GetUp</a> Ruby on Rails and the best practices (such as BDD and Agile) associated with it. Other than that, I've worked with many, many other teams and people developing great Rails applications.</p>

    <p>I attend the RoRoSyd meetups in Sydney, some ActionHacks in Brisbane when I'm about, and all the Australian Railscamps, one of which I helped run. I have been known to travel great distances to attend greater conferences. I enjoy speaking and am open for any opportunities in that area.
    </p>
    
    <p>If you need help with anything Ruby or Rails related, ask me and I can probably help you or get you contact with someone who can. Or you could read my book :)</p>
