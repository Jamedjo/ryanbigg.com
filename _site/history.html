        <h2>History</h2>

<p class='large'>
  Over my development life I've worked with many, many teams developing Elixir, Phoenix, Ruby, Rails, Go and React applications. (Thankfully, not all of those languages/frameworks at the same time.)
</p>

<p class='large'>
  Here's where I've worked and what I've done.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>December '11 &rarr; Current &mdash; Self-published author</h3>

<p class='large'>
  After the success of <a href='http://manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action'>Rails 3 and Rails 4 in Action</a> I decided to strike out on my own and become a self-published author. I do this through <a href='https://leanpub.com'>Leanpub</a> and have published two books (<a href='https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails-2'>Multitenancy with Rails</a> and <a href='https://leanpub.com/toyrobot'>Toy Robot</a>) and I'm currently writing a third (<a href='https://leanpub.com/ddr'>Deep Dive Rails</a>)
</p>

<p>
  You can read more about these books over on <a href='/books'>my books page</a>.
</p>

<p>
  As a part of this writing process, I developed <a href='https://github.com/radar/twist'>a review tool called "Twist"</a> which allows reviewers to leave notes on my books as they read them. It has been extremely useful.
</p>

<h3>August '16 &rarr; Current &mdash; <a href='http://cultureamp.com'>Culture Amp</a></h3>

<p class='large'>
  <a href='http://cultureamp.com'>Culture Amp</a> aims to improve the culture of companies around the world. My work at Culture Amp involves me working with a small team of developers to maintain our large Rails monolith and to write microservices in Elixir.
</p>

<p>
  Part of this work also involves providing Ruby and Elixir mentorship to other developers in the company. I've refined my React/Redux skills here. I love working at Culture Amp because of the supportive / cheery environment.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>January '15 &rarr; August '16 &mdash; <a href='http://marketplacer.com'>Marketplacer</a></h3>

<p class='large'>
  I worked at <a href='http://marketplacer.com'>Marketplacer</a> as a Senior Developer. Marketplacer is an application which powers sites such as <a href='https://www.bikeexchange.com.au'>BikeExchange</a> (also in the <a href='https://www.bikeexchange.com.au'>US</a> and a few countries in Europe), <a href='https://www.tinitrader.com.au'>TiniTrader</a> and <a href='https://www.bikeexchange.com'>BikeExchange</a>. The overall goal of the application is to make it easier for stores and private sellers to sell their goods online.
</p>

<p>
  My day-to-day work involved working on new features for the Marketplacer application, and leading the Core development team. It was here that I was first introduced to Angular and React and where I learned I had a strong preference for React over Angular.
</p>

<h3>July '14 &rarr; Jan '15 &mdash; <a href='http://lifx.co'>LIFX</a></h3>

<p>
  At LIFX I worked on a small team of 3 developers building their Cloud architecture using a mixture of Ruby and Go. This architecture allows users of LIFX lights to control their lights wherever they are in the world; and also provides integration with Nest. For example, if there's smoke detected in the house by a Nest smoke dectector, the LIFX lights will flash red.

<h3>November '11 &rarr; July '14 &mdash; <a href='http://spreecommerce.com'>Spree Commerce</a></h3>

<p class='large'>
  I was hired as the Community Manager for Spree after showing a very keen interest in the framework. I posted a lot to the user group and then one day Sean Schofield (the CEO of Spree) asked if I wanted a job which was essentially being paid to maintain open source. I said yes.
</p>

<p>
  At Spree I was _the_ Community Manager. This is a fancy title which means my primary responsibility was keeping the community happy. I did this by leading the development of the <a href='https://github.com/spree/spree'>Spree ecommerce framework,</a> answering posts on our user group, writing documentation and giving talks all over the world about Spree. In one instance, I was flown to London to consult with a large surf clothing distributor.
</p>

<h3>February '11 &rarr; November '11 &mdash; <a href='http://reinteractive.com'>Reinteractive</a></h3>

<hr>

<p class='large'>
  At Reinteractive I worked as a consultant, doing Rails projects (which included Rails rescue projects; reviving legacy code bases) and code analysis of applications. The biggest project we shipped in my time there was the conversion of <a href='https://shop.abc.net.au'>The ABC Shop</a> to a Rails app.
</p>

<h3>April '10 &rarr; 2016 &mdash; <a href='http://manning.com'>Manning</a></h3>

<p class='large'>
  I was contacted by Manning and asked if I would like to write a book. Around this time I was keeping my blog up-to-date with the latest Rails happenings, and they thought I would make a good author. It turns out they were right.
</p>

<p>
  I wrote <a href='http://manning.com/books/rails-3-in-action'>Rails 3 in Action</a>, which was the first Rails book to show how to develop a Rails application using industry-best-practices when it came to Behaviour-Driven-Development (BDD) and Test-Driven-Development (TDD).
</p>

<p>
  A few years later I got some help from Rebecca Skinner and Steve Klabnik and together we wrote the sequel: <a href='http://manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action'>Rails 4 in Action</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Manning and I parted ways (more than once), and so there <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2017/03/rails-5-in-action'>will not be a Rails 5 in Action</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2010 - <a href='http://getup.com.au'>GetUp</a></h3>

<p class='large'>
  In 2010, I introduced a small team of PHP developers at <a
href="http://getup.org.au">GetUp</a> in Sydney to Ruby on Rails and the best
practices (such as BDD and Agile) associated with it. Our task was to rebuild
the getup.org.au site from the ground up, using Ruby on Rails.
</p>

<h3>2007 &rarr; 2010 &mdash; Various</h3>

<p class='large'>
  My formative years. Spent this time working for various companies and freelancing, doing whatever Ruby on Rails work came my way.
